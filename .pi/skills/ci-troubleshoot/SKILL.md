# CI Troubleshoot

Diagnose CI failures for pi-agent-dashboard. The repo has 10 workflow files: 8 entry workflows and 2 reusable workflows.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  ci[ci.yml] --> checks[tests + lint + build]
  deploy[deploy-site.yml] --> pages[GitHub Pages]
  native[ci-e2e-electron.yml] --> nativeTests[native Electron E2E]
  ciSmoke[ci-smoke.yml] --> smoke[_smoke.yml]
  publish[publish.yml] --> smoke
  ciElectron[ci-electron.yml] --> electron[_electron-build.yml]
  nightly[nightly.yml] --> electron
  publish --> electron
  publish --> release[GitHub Release]
  release --> sync[sync-release-version.yml]
```

Full per-workflow detail: [`references/workflow-taxonomy.md`](references/workflow-taxonomy.md).

## First moves — always run these

```bash
pnpm exec tsx .pi/skills/ci-troubleshoot/scripts/list-recent-runs.ts                  # last 10 runs across all workflows
pnpm exec tsx .pi/skills/ci-troubleshoot/scripts/list-recent-runs.ts --failed         # only failed
pnpm exec tsx .pi/skills/ci-troubleshoot/scripts/show-failed-run.ts <run-id>          # failed steps + log tails
pnpm exec tsx .pi/skills/ci-troubleshoot/scripts/show-failed-run.ts                   # most recent failed run
```

These wrap `gh run list`, `gh run view --log-failed`, and similar. You need `gh auth status` to be authenticated.

> Scripts are TypeScript and cross-platform. All invocations use `pnpm exec tsx`, which resolves the declared local dependency and fails if dependencies are absent. `gh` CLI is cross-platform.

## Triage decision tree

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  red{Run is red?} --> workflow{Which workflow?}
  workflow --> ci[ci.yml]
  workflow --> publish[publish.yml]
  workflow --> electron[ci-electron.yml]
  workflow --> other[Other workflow]
  ci --> common[Tests, lint, build<br/>references/common-failures.md]
  other --> taxonomy[references/workflow-taxonomy.md]
  publish --> releaseJob{Which release job?}
  releaseJob --> tag[tag-and-push]
  releaseJob --> npmOrder[publish: npm ordering]
  releaseJob --> matrix[electron: matrix leg]
  releaseJob --> assets[github-release: asset collision]
  electron --> smoke[On-demand Electron smoke<br/>never publish]
```

## Release pipeline — `publish.yml`

The release flow uses a gated 7-job graph:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  resolve[resolve] --> checks[ci-checks]
  resolve --> smoke[smoke via _smoke.yml]
  checks --> tag[tag-and-push]
  smoke --> tag
  tag --> publish[publish packages]
  publish --> electron[electron via _electron-build.yml]
  electron --> release[github-release]
```

Tag-push runs skip `tag-and-push`; `publish.if` accepts that skip while still requiring checks and smoke. **Do not remove `needs: [resolve, publish]` from `electron`**. The bundled server installs the just-published packages. Locked by `packages/shared/src/__tests__/publish-workflow-contract.test.ts`.

Full walkthrough with per-job failure modes: [`references/release-pipeline.md`](references/release-pipeline.md).

## Known failure modes

Maintained in [`references/common-failures.md`](references/common-failures.md). Headline catalog:

| Failure | Where | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----|
| `verify-lockfile-versions.mjs` fails | `tag-and-push` | Cross-ref specifier in lockfile doesn't match bumped version | Regenerate lockfile + commit; or fix `scripts/sync-versions.js` |
| CHANGELOG already has `## [X.Y.Z]` | `tag-and-push` | You're re-dispatching with a version that was already promoted | Bump to a new version, or revert the CHANGELOG section |
| `npm publish` 403 | `publish` | OIDC trusted publisher not configured for that package | Configure in npm web UI; or temporarily use NPM_TOKEN |
| Electron matrix leg fails | `electron` | Missing prebuild for node-pty/better-sqlite3 on that OS/arch | Check `bundle-server.mjs` GO/NO-GO guard; rebuild prebuilds |
| `shell: bash` on Windows runner | any | Lint test `no-bash-on-windows.test.ts` flags it | Remove `shell: bash` or guard with `if: runner.os != 'Windows'` |
| Electron job missing `needs:` | repo-lint | `publish-workflow-contract.test.ts` failed | Restore `needs: [resolve, publish]` |
| `Cannot find module @blackbelt-technology/...` in electron | `electron` | `publish` job didn't run or failed; bundled server can't resolve from npm | Check `publish` job — re-run only if it failed; never bypass |
| Fastify crashes in bundled server smoke | any using node | Bad Node version pinned in workflow | Bump `node-version:` to ≥ 22.18.0 |
| Loud-but-harmless `EADDRINUSE` in smoke | smoke job | Concurrent server spawns | Usually self-recovering; check next log lines |
| `electron` + `github-release` SKIPPED despite green `publish` | `electron` | Tag-push path skips `tag-and-push`; a skipped needs-ancestor poisons electron's DEFAULT `if: success()` | Give `electron` explicit `if: ${{ !cancelled() && needs.publish.result == 'success' }}` (mirrors `publish`'s guard). First hit v0.6.1 |
| `✗ koffi prebuild GO/NO-GO failed at ...koffi\build\koffi\win32_x64\koffi.node` | `electron` (both win32 legs) | koffi@3.x ships the prebuild at `@koromix/koffi-win32-x64/win32_x64/koffi.node`; the 2.x `koffi/build/...` path is never created | Update `bundle-server.mjs` guard to check the 3.x @koromix path first, 2.x fallback. First hit v0.6.1 |
| arm64 NSIS smoke: `pi-dashboard.exe not found ... after 150s` | `electron` (win32-arm64) | x64 runner can't execute an arm64 `Setup.exe`/app, so silent install extracts nothing | Guard the NSIS install-smoke step `if: matrix.platform == 'win32' && matrix.arch == 'x64'`. arm64 installer still builds+ships. First hit v0.6.1 |

## Reading gh logs efficiently

```bash
# Last 10 runs (all workflows, this branch)
gh run list -L 10

# Last 5 failed runs across all workflows
gh run list -L 50 | grep -E 'failure|cancelled' | awk 'NR <= 5'

# Get a specific run, only the failed steps
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Watch a running workflow (live tail)
gh run watch <run-id>

# Re-run only the failed jobs (preserves successful ones, saves CI time)
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed

# Re-run from scratch (rare; usually for flakes)
gh run rerun <run-id>

# Cancel a stuck run
gh run cancel <run-id>
```

`gh run view --log-failed` is the highest-leverage one — it pulls only failed-step output, which is what you want 95% of the time.

**Never bypass the release pipeline with a manual `npm publish`.** That loses OIDC trusted publishing, lockfile synchronization, changelog promotion, smoke gates, and Electron dependency ordering.

**Rerun gotcha (tag-push releases):** `gh run rerun <id> --failed` does NOT re-dispatch skipped downstream reusable-workflow jobs (e.g. `electron`) even after `publish` flips green — they stay `skipped`. After a smoke-**gate** flake on a tag-push release, re-push the tag for a clean single-pass run instead: `git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. `publish` is idempotent (skips already-published packages), so re-pushing the tag is safe.

## When the failure is repo-lint

Repo-lint tests fail the `ci` job specifically. They're listed in `debug-dashboard/references/test-failure-triage.md` → "Repo-lint tests". Fix the file that violated the rule. **Don't loosen the lint** — each one exists because of a real regression.
