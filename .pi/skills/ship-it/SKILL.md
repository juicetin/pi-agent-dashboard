# ship-it

Orchestrates the **implementation phase** of an OpenSpec change **inside its git
worktree**. Twin of `plan-proposal` (which runs the planning phase on `develop`).
Composes existing skills — `openspec-apply-change`, the docker harness, and
`ship-change` — and adds the wiring they lack. Runnable **headless**.

Pure decision logic lives in this skill's own `scripts/` directory and is
unit-tested (`.pi/skills/ship-it` is a vitest project):
`scripts/manifest.ts` (`parseManifest`, `deferDecision`, `filesystemRealityCheck`),
`scripts/no-weakening.ts` (`assertNoWeakening`), and
`scripts/review-gate.ts` (`reviewRoundDecision`, `resolveReviewer`,
`classifyFindings`, `REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS`).

## Preconditions

- Running **inside the change's worktree** (`.worktrees/os-<change>`, branch
  `os/<change>`). Resolve the change name from the worktree dir basename.
- `docker` available (the e2e harness); `openspec` CLI resolves from the parent
  repo root when inside a worktree (per `AGENTS.md`).
- Announce: *"Shipping change: `<change>` (worktree implementation phase)."*

## Procedure

### 1. Orient with `openspec status`, but gate on filesystem reality (idempotent)

Read `openspec status --change <change> --json` for orientation only. **Do not
trust the `tasks.md` checkbox** as proof an automated scenario is done — a
hand-checked or prior-partial `- [x]` can lie.

Parse `test-plan.md` (`parseManifest`). For each `automated` row, resolve its
folded test file and run `filesystemRealityCheck`: a scenario is satisfied only
when its **test file exists AND passes in the harness** (step 3). Any automated
row whose test file is absent → NOT done → author it (step 2) regardless of the
checkbox. This makes re-invocation genuinely idempotent: fresh run and re-run
reach the same all-green end state.

### 2. Run apply if non-manual work remains — inject the exemplar

**kb-first, even as an executor.** You know which files the tasks name, so your
reflex is `grep`/`cat`/Read on them directly. The docs-first gate still applies:
before you `grep`/`rg` for a symbol, Read a file to learn its purpose, or chase
an import, run `kb_search` / `kb agents <path>` / `kb_neighbors` FIRST. Knowing
the file does not exempt you — kb the symbol/file, then edit.

If non-`manual-only` tasks remain (real code + the test files the fold tasked),
run `openspec-apply-change` for the change. `apply` writes code and marks tasks.

`apply` has no "copy from exemplar" capability of its own. For each folded test
task, **resolve the harness-exemplar pointer** (the nearest existing spec of that
category named in the task) and inject its path into the task context you hand
`apply` — or author the spec yourself in the fix loop (step 4). Bare
"author X.spec.ts" with no exemplar is forbidden.

### 2.5. Integrate `develop` — merge before the harness (primary integration point)

The harness (step 3) is the **strongest gate** on the ship-it path, so integration
must sit **upstream** of it: the harness must validate the merged tree `T1`, not
the pre-merge tree `T0`. Merge `origin/develop` — the **remote ref**, never local
`develop` (checked out in the parent repo → worktree branch-collision pitfall):

```bash
git fetch origin develop
git merge --no-edit origin/develop
```

Idempotent: up-to-date → "Already up to date", no merge commit, safe to always
run. **Merge, not rebase** — step 9 squash-merges anyway, so rebase's linear
history is moot while its force-push is a documented `ship-change` footgun.

**Conflict → abort + STOP.** On an unresolved conflict, `git merge --abort`,
report, and do **not** enter the harness — never run the gate on a half-merged
tree. Resolve trivial conflicts with `ship-change`'s existing recipes (`AGENTS.md`
union-keep; `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `git checkout --theirs` +
`pnpm install --lockfile-only`), then re-run the merge. A conflict you cannot
resolve mechanically → escape hatch (step 5).

### 3. Harness lifecycle — delegate the port, always tear down

Obtain the harness and its port from `docker/test-up.sh` (allocator on first run,
reuser on re-up — do NOT add port code). Read the derived port from
`.pi-test-harness.json` (`dashboardPort`) — **never hardcode `:18000`**.

Wrap the whole run so teardown ALWAYS happens (red test, abort, or a partial
`test-up.sh` start):

```bash
cleanup() { docker/test-down.sh || true; }
trap cleanup EXIT
docker/test-up.sh -d --build            # allocates + records .pi-test-harness.json
port=$(jq -r '.dashboardPort' .pi-test-harness.json)   # jq is present in the harness env
# run the relevant suite against $port:
PW_E2E_USE_RUNNING=1 npm run test:e2e   # L3; or the L1/L2 suite for other levels
```

`test-down.sh` is safe against a partially-created compose project (`compose down
-v` + best-effort `rm`). Per-worktree compose-project isolation keeps one
worktree's leak from blocking another.

### 4. Red-test fix loop — OWNED by ship-it (apply cannot fix a checked task)

`apply` marks `- [ ]` → `- [x]` and never revisits a checked task, so re-invoking
`apply` on a red-but-checked test no-ops. **On a red test, `ship-it` drives the
fix itself** — edit the code or the test, re-run the harness. Never re-invoke
`apply` on an already-checked task.

Bound the loop by **progress-making cycles**, not a fixed count:

- A cycle that changes the worktree and moves the harness result counts.
- A cycle that produces **no change** to the worktree → **STOP immediately** and
  escalate (step 5). Do not spin.
- This bound is independent of doubt-review's 3-cycle bound (different semantics).

**No-weakening guardrail (mechanical, enforced every cycle):** before accepting a
change to a test file, run `assertNoWeakening` on its diff
(`git diff -- <test-file>`). If it reports `ok:false` (added `.only`/`skip`,
deleted assertion, or a strong→permissive matcher swap), **REJECT** the change —
you may not reach green by degrading the test. Fix the code instead.

### 4.4. Deterministic enforcers — cheap, offline, before any model call

Run the enforcers from the worktree root. Each is already the sole owner of its
rule; this step only *invokes* them:

```bash
node scripts/check-conventions.mjs --base origin/develop
node scripts/dox-byte-gate.mjs
node scripts/i18n-lint.mjs --strict     # --strict, else it exits 0 regardless
node scripts/i18n-parity.mjs
```

They are placed here, after the harness and before the review, because they are
deterministic, offline and near-instant: a mechanically-failing tree must never
spend a model call. A non-zero exit routes to the step-4 fix loop; **step 4.5
does not run**.

`--base` is mandatory for gating: without it the touched set is undefined and
the Discipline-Skills and Mermaid rules report without gating. The touched set
unions the committed diff with the working tree, so fixes still uncommitted in
the fix loop are inspected.

These do NOT move into `quality:changed`. That script is the dev-loop oracle and
has no automated caller; the ship gate is here.

### 4.5. Local review checkpoint — the semantic half

Runs on **every** invocation. There is no triviality escape: no diff-size, path,
or changed-file-count condition skips it.

1. **Resolve the reviewer** with `resolveReviewer` from `scripts/review-gate.ts`.
   `@review` is REQUIRED. Unconfigured → hard fail naming `update_roles` / the
   dashboard Roles panel. There is deliberately **no fallback to the session
   default model**: that model is the author, so falling back turns the gate into
   self-review. Interactive runs may offer the bootstrap prompt; a headless run
   fails.
2. **Spawn it as an isolated subagent** — an `Agent` call with `model: "@review"`
   carrying `review-code`'s rubric. Never an in-context self-review, never the
   CodeRabbit CLI (that is `ship-change`'s remote gate, later and different).
3. **Feed it diff + intent**: `git diff origin/develop...HEAD` (three-dot, so the
   step-2.5 merge is not attributed to this change) plus uncommitted worktree
   edits, plus `proposal.md` and the task text.
4. **Bound the call** by `REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS` (300s). A timeout is neither a pass
   nor a blocking finding — it is a checkpoint failure.
5. **Route findings** with `classifyFindings`: only `issue(blocking)` re-enters
   the fix loop. Everything else is reported and shipped.
6. **Bound the loop** with `reviewRoundDecision`: review, fix, re-review —
   **never a third round**. This is a hard numeric cap, NOT step 4's no-progress
   rule, because a reviewer can emit a fresh finding every round and each fix
   changes the worktree, so a no-progress bound would never fire.
7. `assertNoWeakening` still governs every test edit a review fix makes. A
   finding that can only be satisfied by weakening a test is **unsatisfiable** →
   escape hatch (step 5), naming both the finding and the guardrail. The
   guardrail is never relaxed to reach green.

Every `escape` decision carries a `reason`; write it into `SHIP_IT_BLOCKED.md`.

### 5. Boundary-reverse escape hatch

The worktree boundary is **not one-way**. Trigger the reverse path when EITHER:

- `apply` reports a design issue (NL prose — implementation reveals the design is
  wrong), OR
- the step-4 fix bound is exhausted (a no-progress cycle).

Then, **do NOT headlessly rewrite `proposal.md`/`design.md`**:

1. Leave the worktree intact (no revert).
2. Write `openspec/changes/<change>/SHIP_IT_BLOCKED.md` naming the failing
   scenario / design gap and what was tried.
3. Exit non-zero.
4. Surface via the dashboard so a human re-enters `plan-proposal` /
   `doubt-driven-review` on `develop`.

### 6. Drive ship-change INLINE, with manifest-aware defer + teardown ordering

Once every automated scenario is green (harness-verified), ship. Execute
`ship-change`'s procedure **inline** (not as a black-box subagent) so you keep
step-level control for the teardown ordering below.

**Defer rule (`deferDecision`, manifest-aware):**
- `test-plan.md` exists → a leftover `- [ ]` is deferrable only if it maps to a
  `manual-only` manifest row (inline `(test-plan: manual-only)` or a
  `(test-plan #<id>)` reference resolved against the manifest). Any other leftover
  = real work = **STOP** (return to step 2, or the escape hatch).
- `test-plan.md` absent (legacy change) → `ship-change`'s current keyword defer
  applies unchanged.

**Archive+sync gate before the destructive steps (load-bearing):** do **not** let
`ship-change` merge the PR, delete the branch, or remove the worktree while the
proposal is not archived and specs are not synced. `ship-change` step 8.5 is that
hard gate — driving `ship-change` inline, hold at step 8.5 until the change is
archived (source dir moved to `openspec/changes/archive/`, move committed) and
specs synced. Failed/skipped archive → STOP (return to step 2 or the escape hatch),
never proceed to steps 9/10.

**Teardown-before-removal ordering (load-bearing):** the harness MUST be torn down
(`test-down.sh`, already wired via the step-3 trap) **before** `ship-change` step
10 removes the worktree. A leaked container makes the worktree "busy" and stalls
removal. Run the harness teardown, then let `ship-change` archive → commit → PR →
CI → CodeRabbit → (archive+sync gate) → squash-merge → remove worktree.

## Guardrails

- **Idempotent on filesystem reality** — checkbox `- [x]` is never proof; the
  test file must exist and pass in the harness.
- **ship-it owns the fix loop** — never re-invoke `apply` on a checked task.
- **Never weaken a test to reach green** — `assertNoWeakening` rejects it.
- **Enforcers (4.4) before the reviewer (4.5)** — never spend a model call on a
  mechanically-failing tree.
- **The review is unconditional** — no triviality escape, and `@review` is
  required; never fall back to the session default model (that is self-review).
- **Two review rounds, hard cap** — review, fix, re-review, then escape. Not a
  no-progress bound: a model always makes "progress".
- **Merge `develop` before the harness (step 2.5)** — the strong gate validates
  the integrated tree `T1`; merge `origin/develop` (remote ref), never rebase.
  Conflict → abort + STOP, never enter the harness on a half-merged tree.
- **Never merge / delete branch / remove worktree while the proposal is not archived and synced** — hold at `ship-change` step 8.5 (archive+sync gate) until it passes; failed archive → STOP.
- **Always tear the harness down** (trap/finally), **before** worktree removal.
- **Never hardcode `:18000`** — read `dashboardPort` from `.pi-test-harness.json`.
- **Never headlessly rewrite planning artifacts** — use the escape hatch.
- **Drive ship-change inline** — do not spawn it as a subagent (you need its step
  boundaries for teardown ordering).

## Composed skills

`openspec-apply-change` · `docker/test-up.sh` + `lib-ports.sh` + `test-down.sh` ·
`review-code` (its rubric is what the step-4.5 reviewer applies) ·
`ship-change` (driven inline, manifest-aware defer). Handoff back to
`plan-proposal` via `SHIP_IT_BLOCKED.md`.
