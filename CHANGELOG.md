## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`ask_user` batch method:** the `ask_user` tool now accepts `{method: "batch", title, questions: [...], message?}` to ask multiple related questions in one call. Sub-questions execute sequentially via existing `ctx.ui.*` primitives (no adapter changes). Mid-batch cancellation returns partial results with `cancelled: true`. `prepareArguments` rescues the common LLM drift shapes Opus 4.7 emits: stringified `questions` arrays, explicit `method: "batch"` without an outer `title` (backfilled from the first sub-question), `input_type` wrapper flattening, `header`/`question` → `title`, `{label,value}[]` options normalized to labels with a warning surfaced in `details.warnings`. Schema forbids nesting (batches cannot contain batches). Backward compatible — all existing single-method shapes unchanged.
- **LandingPage onboarding:** empty-state main pane now renders three
  guided steps (① Setup credentials → ② Add folder → ③ Start session)
  with live state (pending / done / locked). Each step collapses to a
  compact ✔ row once satisfied, so returning users see a status strip
  rather than a wall of onboarding. Credentials detection consults BOTH
  `/api/providers` (baseUrl+apiKey config) AND
  `/api/provider-auth/status` (pi OAuth / auth.json) — new
  `useProvidersReady()` hook refetches on window focus and
  `provider-auth-event`. `PinDirectoryDialog` lifted from `SessionList`
  to the app root so the sidebar "Add folder" button and the
  LandingPage Step ② CTA share one mount via `onOpenPinDialog`.
- **OpenSpec session card lifecycle UI:** the attached-change row now
  shows an explicit `ChangeState` pill (PLANNING / READY /
  IMPLEMENTING / COMPLETE), a `Tasks N/M` button that opens a popover
  for toggling individual `tasks.md` checkboxes (backed by new
  `GET /api/openspec/tasks` and `POST /api/openspec/tasks/toggle`
  endpoints with optimistic-concurrency line tokens), and an overflow
  `⋯` menu with **Archive anyway** when artifacts are authored
  (`isComplete: true`) but manual-verification tasks remain unchecked.
  **Bulk Archive** moved to unattached sessions only.
- **Bundle splitting** for the web client: `vite.config.ts` now
  manually chunks React, markdown, syntax-highlighter, git-diff-view,
  xterm, dnd-kit, and utility libs into separate vendor chunks. Initial
  main chunk drops from 3.1 MB to 570 KB (~150 KB gzipped), avoiding
  tunnel abort thresholds on large assets.
- **HTTP response compression** on the Fastify server via
  `@fastify/compress` (gzip + deflate, threshold 1 KB). Brotli is
  intentionally disabled because the zrok free proxy stream-resets
  `content-encoding: br` responses under parallel browser load.
- **Orphan zrok process scavenger**
  (`scavengeOrphanZrokProcesses(port)`): scans `ps -ax` for
  `zrok share … --override-endpoint http://localhost:<port>` processes
  that escaped pid-file tracking and SIGTERMs them. Runs unconditionally
  on startup when the zrok binary is present (even in `--no-tunnel`
  mode) and from `deleteTunnel(port)`.
- **Reserved share release** (`releaseShare(token)`): best-effort
  `zrok release <token>` wrapper invoked when the retry path, timeout
  path, or cleanup path would otherwise leak a dead reservation on the
  zrok edge.
- **Recommended extensions**: new *Packages* tab surfaces a curated set of pi
  extensions (pi-anthropic-messages, pi-subagents, pi-flows, pi-web-access,
  pi-agent-browser) with install/uninstall actions, live npm/GitHub enrichment,
  and a top-of-page banner when any *required* extension is missing from
  `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.
- **Recommended-extensions wizard step** in the first-run setup, with
  already-installed entries greyed out.
- **Pi core version checker + updater**: a new header badge shows how many pi
  ecosystem core packages (pi itself, pi-dashboard, pi-model-proxy, …) have
  updates available. A *Packages* settings section lists current → latest
  versions with per-package and "Update All" actions, live progress, and
  automatic session reload on successful update.
- **Image paste in the OpenSpec explore dialog** — drop or paste screenshots
  directly into the explore prompt, matching the main command input. Powered by
  a shared `useImagePaste` hook and `ImagePreviewStrip` component so behaviour
  is identical across both surfaces.
- **Error banner improvements**: long LLM errors now collapse to a summary line
  with *Retry* and *Copy* buttons; full detail expands on demand.
- **Model selector upgrades**: provider filter and multi-token typeahead search
  in the model picker. The same `ModelSelector` component now powers the
  default-model setting in *Settings*.
- **Anthropic payload transform extension** for the main session, delegating
  the transform to the shared `@pi/anthropic-messages` package.
- **Public marketing site** at `/site` (Astro + Tailwind + MDX + Preact)
  deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`, with a
  50 KB gzipped JS budget enforced in CI.
- **`ask_user` batch questions**: new `batch` method accepts a
  `questions[]` array to ask multiple questions in a single dialog, with
  sequential execution, mid-batch cancellation returning partial
  results, and forgiving argument coercion (stringified arrays,
  `input_type` → `method`, `{label, value}` option normalization) so
  common LLM drift no longer stacks validation errors.
- **Cross-platform QA VMs**: new `qa/` directory provides Packer-built
  Ubuntu / Windows / macOS base images plus clone → boot → test →
  destroy lifecycle scripts. `make build-*`, `make test-*`, and
  `make manual-*` targets verify clean-state installation and runtime
  of the dashboard across platforms from a single command.
- **Persistent editor PID registry**: spawned `code-server` processes
  are now recorded to `~/.pi/dashboard/editor-pids.json`. On server
  boot, orphans from prior non-graceful exits (SIGKILL, crash, OOM,
  force-quit) are detected via cmdline ownership check and terminated
  with SIGTERM → 1 s grace → SIGKILL, freeing their bound port and
  `--user-data-dir` lockfile so next-click editor spawns don’t
  collide.

### Changed
- `createTunnel()` is now serialized: concurrent calls return the same
  in-flight promise (`pendingCreate`) instead of spawning parallel
  `zrok share` processes. A UI double-click or a race between startup
  auto-connect and `/api/tunnel-connect` no longer creates duplicate
  reservations.
- `deleteTunnel(port?)` now also scavenges orphan processes when a port
  is supplied. Called from graceful shutdown, `/api/shutdown`,
  `/api/restart`, and `/api/tunnel-disconnect`.
- Reserved-share retry in `createTunnel()` is capped at 1 attempt and
  explicitly releases the old token before reserving a new one.
  Previously a single restart could leak 3+ reservations (and 3+
  processes) as the retry chain compounded.
- Tunnel-creation timeout path escalates SIGTERM→SIGKILL after a 2 s
  grace period and releases any just-in-time-reserved token before
  resolving `null`.
- **Provider auth flow**: saving provider credentials now broadcasts
  `credentials_updated` to all sessions, refreshes the model registry, and
  pushes updated models to every connected client. The model selector updates
  in place without a manual reload.
- **OAuth device flow**: replaced the auto-popup with an explicit button so
  the browser no longer gets blocked by popup policies.
- **Folder action bar**: removed the deprecated *+Terminal* quick-create
  button. Use the *Terminals* tab to open a new PTY.
- **File search**: replaced the `fd` binary dependency with a native Node.js
  directory walk, eliminating a platform-specific binary and simplifying
  packaging for Windows and portable installs.
- **`CommandInput` refactor**: image-paste logic extracted into the shared
  `useImagePaste` hook and `ImagePreviewStrip` component (see *Added* above).
- **Path picker**: directory filtering moved server-side via a new `q`
  query param on `GET /api/browse` (case-insensitive substring with
  4-tier ranking: exact > prefix > word-boundary > substring, applied
  before the 200-entry cap so best matches always survive). Client
  sends debounced typed input with in-flight cancellation. Enter now
  follows a strict state machine (exact match > unique prefix >
  highlighted row), and a new `POST /api/browse/mkdir` endpoint lets
  users create a folder inline from the picker.
- **Sidebar brand mark**: the sidebar header’s literal `π` glyph is
  replaced by a new inline-SVG `PiLogo` component
  (`fill="currentColor"`, transparent background) that inherits the
  button’s `text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-400` theme colors. Applied
  to both `SessionList` (desktop) and `SessionSidebar` (alternate).
- **“Working” session indicator**: cards in the working state now
  render an animated diagonal barber-pole stripe pattern
  (`.card-working-pulse`) in addition to the existing opacity pulse,
  making the working vs. waiting-on-user distinction unambiguous at a
  glance. `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the animation but keeps
  the static stripe pattern as a state cue.
- **Pin-folder button label**: the sidebar “pin a folder” button now
  reads `📌 Add folder` (with tooltip “Pin a folder to the sidebar”)
  instead of the icon-only `📌+`.

### Fixed
- Stale zrok URLs (e.g. `https://<token>.share.zrok.io` returning 404
  or `bad gateway!`) caused by the server leaking reservations across
  restarts without killing the old agent or releasing the token on the
  zrok edge.
- `POST /api/restart` and `POST /api/shutdown` now call
  `deleteTunnel(config.port)` before exit; previously they bypassed
  the graceful-shutdown path and left zrok processes behind.
- Browser `ERR_ABORTED 500` errors on every asset when the dashboard
  was accessed via a zrok tunnel URL. Root cause: Vite emits
  `<script type="module" crossorigin>` which forces browsers to request
  assets in CORS mode even same-origin. The server's CORS callback
  threw on unknown origins (tunnel URL wasn't in the allow list) which
  @fastify/cors surfaced as HTTP 500. Now: the active tunnel URL and
  any `*.share.zrok.io` host are auto-allowed, and unknown origins
  return `cb(null, false)` (no CORS headers, no 500) instead of
  throwing. curl kept working throughout because it never sent an
  `Origin` header.
- Pre-compressed (`.gz`) sibling files are now generated at build time
  and served directly by `@fastify/static` with stable `Content-Length`
  headers, avoiding streaming-compression edge cases in intermediate
  HTTP/2 proxies.
- **Portable Windows**: `pi-coding-agent` is now resolved from the managed
  install under `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` instead of expecting a system
  install — portable zips work out of the box.
- **Prompt templates**: resolved from global skills and installed packages,
  not just the local project. Template names are split on any whitespace so
  multi-line arguments work.
- **Installed-packages list** auto-refreshes after install/remove/update
  operations complete — no more stale counts.
- **Assistant text in replay / fork messages** now renders properly instead
  of showing an empty separator.
- **New terminal tabs** auto-focus when created and the UI navigates to the
  folder view.
- **Fork entryId timing**: leaf registry fix so forked sessions resolve their
  parent message correctly.
- **Roles edit from dashboard** now works as expected.
- **`ask_user` tool**: hardened argument validation to reject malformed
  payloads instead of silently misbehaving.
- **Pi core update completion**: server now broadcasts
  `pi_core_update_complete` so the header badge refetches and clears.
- **Server robustness**: `node-pty` permissions fix is now hoist-aware (works
  regardless of which workspace triggered the install), and the browser
  gateway logs handler errors instead of swallowing them silently.

### Docs
- README updated with Electron standalone install instructions, monorepo
  paths, and new feature callouts.
- OpenSpec proposals added for the dashboard-ux-fixes batch and the explore
  dialog image-paste change.

## [0.2.0 – 0.2.9] - 2026-04-13 – 2026-04-16

*Initial public releases — installer and cross-platform CI hardening.*

These versions were primarily focused on getting CI to reliably produce
installers across macOS, Linux, and Windows (including arm64). The only
user-visible items worth calling out:

- npm package renamed to `@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` to match
  the GitHub repository (v0.2.1).
- Windows release artifacts now include a ZIP and a portable `.exe` in
  addition to the NSIS installer (v0.2.3).
- arm64 release artifacts added for Linux and Windows (v0.2.6).
- AppImage builds now work on Linux thanks to `libfuse2` in the CI image
  (v0.2.0).
- Docker cross-platform build pipeline added for producing Linux + Windows
  installers from macOS (v0.2.5).

For per-commit detail, see the Git history
(`git log v0.2.0..v0.2.9`).
