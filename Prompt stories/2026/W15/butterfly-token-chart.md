# How we did it: Click-to-open image lightbox in the chat window — an AI collaboration guideline

## 1. Goal (the ask)

The operator wanted inline chat thumbnails to be **clickable**. First prompt:

> "/skill:openspec-explore — In the chat window images are embedded qs a tumbnail.
> When I click to image show in a dialog. Esc close it."

Once the two follow-up steering turns landed, the *real* objective was sharper: a
single reusable `ImageLightbox` overlay wired into **all three** places images appear
(user messages, tool-result images, paste previews), with **zoom/pan** (not just a
static full-size view), closing on **Esc or backdrop click**. The whole thing was to
be carried end-to-end through the OpenSpec lifecycle — explore → proposal → design →
specs → tasks → apply (TDD) → verify → archive — not hacked in ad hoc.

## 2. TL;DR playbook

1. **Start in explore mode, not code.** `/skill:openspec-explore` + a one-line
   description. Let the AI map the current image render paths (it found 3: `ChatView`
   300px, `ToolCallStep` 512px, `CommandInput` 16px) and surface the reusable
   `useZoomPan` hook *before* proposing anything.
2. **Add the quality bar early.** "I would like to be able to zoom/pan → yes." This
   turned a static dialog into a real lightbox and pinned reuse of the existing hook.
3. **`create proposal`**, then `/opsx:ff` to fast-forward design → specs → tasks in one
   pass (9 tasks across component / wiring / tests).
4. **`/opsx:apply`** and insist on TDD: write the failing test first, then the
   component. Expect a portal-testing fight (see §7) — budget for it.
5. **Extract one `ImageLightbox` component** (`DialogPortal` + `useZoomPan`) and wire
   `cursor-pointer` + `onClick` into all 3 call sites. Don't fork three variants.
6. **Run the full suite after wiring**, not just the new test — confirm the 52 existing
   tests still pass (they became 59).
7. **`npm run build`** to catch compile errors the vitest run misses.
8. **Manually smoke-test with real images:** download a few (`curl` to `/tmp`) and
   `read` them into the live session so they render in the actual dashboard chat.
9. **`/opsx:verify`** then **`/opsx:archive`** — sync delta specs to
   `openspec/specs/` and move the change to `openspec/changes/archive/<date>-<name>/`.

## 3. How the collaboration unfolded

**Phase 1 — Explore (00:10–00:14).** The AI spawned an `Explore` subagent to map image
rendering, then drew a Mermaid graph of the three render sites and confirmed
`useZoomPan` already existed. *Why it worked:* grounding the change in the real code
(3 concrete call sites + a reusable hook) made the scope self-evident and killed
speculative design. **Decision point:** operator added "zoom/pan" — the AI folded it in
by reusing the hook instead of inventing new pan logic.

**Phase 2 — Artifacts (00:14–00:16).** `create proposal`, then `/opsx:ff` generated
design → specs (4 requirements, 9 scenarios) → tasks (9 tasks, 3 groups) in one sweep.
*Why it worked:* a small, well-bounded change is exactly what fast-forward is for — no
per-artifact hand-holding needed.

**Phase 3 — Apply / TDD (00:38–00:45).** Tests first (failing), then the component,
then wiring into `ChatView`, `ReadToolRenderer`, `CommandInput`. Most of the elapsed
effort here was a **jsdom portal-event fight** (§7). Once green, the AI ran the full
suite (59 passing) and `npm run build`.

**Phase 4 — Real-image smoke test (06:27).** Hours later the operator asked to "download
some images with browser and read to test in this dashboard session." The AI `curl`-ed
a cat, a street scene, and the Google logo into `/tmp` and `read` them so they appeared
as real attachments in the live chat — a genuine end-to-end check, not just unit tests.

**Phase 5 — Verify + archive (06:29–06:45).** `/opsx:verify` produced a
completeness/correctness/coherence report (9/9 tasks, 4/4 requirements, 5/5 design
decisions, one WARNING). Then sync delta specs → archive.

## 4. Prompts that worked

- **Goal prompt** — pairing `/skill:openspec-explore` with a plain-language description
  was the right kickoff: it forced discovery before design. Stronger version: *"Explore
  how images render in chat today, list every call site, and tell me which existing
  hooks I can reuse before proposing a change."*
- **High-leverage follow-up: "zoom/pan → yes."** Six words that upgraded the whole
  feature and locked in hook reuse. Adding the quality bar in phase 1 (not after apply)
  is why it stayed cheap.
- **"download some images with browser and read to test in this dashboard session"** —
  a great forcing function for a real end-to-end check. Turns "tests pass" into "I can
  see it work."
- The `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:archive` slash-skills carried
  the lifecycle — the operator drove the workflow by *naming the stage*, not
  re-explaining intent each time.

## 5. Steering & corrections (what to watch for)

| The AI tended to… | The human had to steer by… | Bake this in next time by… |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scope a plain click-to-open dialog | "I would like zoom/pan → yes" | State interaction richness (zoom/pan/Esc/backdrop) in the goal prompt |
| Stay in unit-test land | "download images … read to test in this dashboard session" | Add a "smoke-test with real images in the live chat" task to the plan |
| Reach for a test-only attribute in prod logic (`data-testid` backdrop check) | verify caught it as a WARNING | Prefer a semantic `data-*` attribute for prod click-target detection |

The operator's steering was mostly *stage advancement* (each `/opsx:*` prompt) plus two
substantive redirects: add zoom/pan, and prove it with real images. Both are worth
stating up front.

## 6. Skills, tools & memory created — and why they're effective

No new skill or memory was created — the session **consumed** the existing OpenSpec
skill chain (`openspec-explore` / `-ff` / `-apply` / `-verify` / `-archive`) rather than
producing a reusable asset. The reusable win was **architectural, not procedural**:
one `ImageLightbox` component (`DialogPortal` + `useZoomPan`) fanned into 3 call sites,
so any future image surface gets click-to-zoom for free by adding `cursor-pointer` +
`onClick` + the shared component.

If anything deserves capturing as a skill, it's the **jsdom portal-event testing
recipe** from §7 — it cost the bulk of the apply phase and will recur for any
`createPortal`/`DialogPortal` component.

## 7. Pitfalls & dead ends

- **Portal content is invisible to `container.querySelector`.** `createPortal` renders
  into `document.body`, outside the test container. → Query from `document.body`, not
  `container`.
- **`fireEvent.click` on a portal backdrop didn't reach React's onClick.** Multiple dead
  ends chased: native `addEventListener` on a ref (ref not set in `useEffect` inside a
  portal), wrapping in `act`, callback refs. **What finally worked:** a `document`-level
  click listener that identifies the backdrop by its data attribute. → For portal close-
  on-backdrop, listen on `document` and match the target, don't rely on a React handler
  on the portal root.
- **`openspec change new <name>` failed** — the correct scaffold path was
  `mkdir openspec/changes/<name>` + `openspec status --json` to drive artifact order.
- **A `FileReader` paste mock fought the test** (`onload` fired synchronously inside
  React's event dispatch, `dataUrl.split(",")[1]` blew up). → Either wrap in `act` and
  fix the mock's `result`, or assert the `cursor-pointer`/`onClick` wiring directly
  instead of simulating the full paste flow.
- **`data-testid`-driven prod logic** slipped in for backdrop detection — flagged by
  verify. Acceptable but not ideal; use a dedicated `data-*` attribute.
- **vitest green ≠ ships.** Always follow with `npm run build` to catch the TS/compile
  errors the test run doesn't.

## 8. Reproduce it faster — checklist

- [ ] `/skill:openspec-explore` + one-line description → let the AI map every render
      site and name reusable hooks before designing.
- [ ] State interaction richness (zoom/pan, Esc, backdrop-close) **in the first prompt**.
- [ ] `create proposal` → `/opsx:ff` for a small bounded change (design/specs/tasks in one).
- [ ] `/opsx:apply` with TDD; **budget time for the portal-event testing fight**
      (query `document.body`; `document`-level backdrop listener).
- [ ] Extract **one** shared `ImageLightbox` (`DialogPortal` + `useZoomPan`); wire
      `cursor-pointer` + `onClick` into every call site.
- [ ] Run the **full** suite, then `npm run build`.
- [ ] Smoke-test with **real** images: `curl` a few to `/tmp`, `read` them into the live
      session, confirm click/zoom/pan/Esc in the actual dashboard.
- [ ] `/opsx:verify` → address WARNINGs → `/opsx:archive` (sync delta specs, move to archive).

**Inputs to have ready:** the OpenSpec CLI + skill chain; the existing `useZoomPan` hook
and `DialogPortal`; a couple of throwaway image URLs.
**Artifacts produced:** `src/client/components/ImageLightbox.tsx` (+ test), edits to
`ChatView.tsx`, `ReadToolRenderer.tsx`, `CommandInput.tsx`, 4 test files (59 passing),
and the archived change `openspec/changes/archive/2026-04-08-image-lightbox/`.
