  #
  # The provider therefore has to be on disk BEFORE the server starts. A spec
  # cannot arrange that itself: `pi-state` is a RAM-backed tmpfs (compose.test
  # .yml), so every container start hands the server a fresh, empty `~/.pi` and
  # discards anything a previous process wrote through `PUT /api/config`. That
  # is the harness's isolation model, not a bug — so the seed goes here.
  #
  # `github` is the one built-in provider that resolves with NO network I/O
  # (static endpoints, no OIDC discovery), so this works in an offline CI box.
  #
  # `bypassUrls:["/"]` is MANDATORY and load-bearing: requests from the
  # Playwright host arrive as NON-loopback, so an armed auth gate with no bypass
  # would lock every other spec out of the shared harness. The prefix matches
  # every URL, so the gate denies nothing while still registering the routes

  #     selects scoped vs legacy resolution.
  # bad-registration flips the escape hatch so the bridge is NOT mirrored into

# session can never demonstrate reconnect-after-restart: there is nothing left to
# re-register. This launches a pi that the dashboard did NOT spawn, exactly like a
# TUI session a user started themselves. It is absent from `headlessPidRegistry`,
# so a server restart leaves it running and its bridge reconnects — the real-world
# path `restore-ask-user-tool-state-on-reconnect` repairs.
#
# `--mode rpc` speaks JSON-RPC over stdio; with stdin closed it reads EOF and
# exits immediately, so `tail -f /dev/null` holds the pipe open. `setsid` detaches
# it from PID 1's process group so a restart cannot cascade into it.
# PI_DIR is only assigned inside the PI_E2E_SEED block above, but this line is
# evaluated unconditionally — so under `set -u` a plain (unseeded) test-up.sh
# died here immediately after its own smoke reported "dashboard ready",
# exiting 1 and failing every e2e health check. Default it the same way the
# seed block does.
