# Distilled Current-State Playwright Test Cases

> **Generated:** 2026-07-04. Companion to `archived-frontend-test-cases.md`.
> **340** distinct, **code-verified** test cases distilled from **1811** historic candidates (431 archived changes).
> Every case was checked against the CURRENT source in `packages/client/src` + plugin `src/client` dirs. Drifted behaviors were dropped.

## What this is

The historic inventory captured *what was once true*. This document captures *what is testable now*. Pipeline:

1. **1811** historic candidates → anchor-grep vs current code → dropped **102 DRIFTED + 41 no-UI**.
2. Remaining **1668** clustered into 18 functional surfaces; each surface's cases checked by `google/gemma-4-31b-it` workers **against a digest of the real current component source** (testids, visible text, roles, handlers) → **482** code-grounded assertions kept, the rest dropped as drifted.
3. Per-surface dedup + coverage tagging vs the **32 existing `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`** → **340** distinct cases.

## Legend

- **[NEW]** — coverage gap: no existing e2e spec tests this. Highest-value to author. (**320** cases)
- **[COVERED]** — an existing `tests/e2e` spec already asserts this. (**20** cases)
- **[target]** — the current component or `data-testid` the case exercises (from live source).

## ⚠️ Caveat

Cases are grounded in a *source digest* (testids/text/handlers), not a running app. Before authoring a spec, open the named component to confirm the exact selector and interaction. Digests can miss dynamically-generated testids.

## Session Cards, List & Sidebar

- [ ] **NEW** [session-card-desktop] Selecting a session card applies the selected highlight (blue border + tint + ring) and expands it to reveal detail sections; non-selected cards stay compact with the blended secondary+tertiary background.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-card-spawn-worktree] Clicking session-card-spawn-worktree opens the WorktreeSpawnDialog scoped to the session cwd and spawns a worktree-backed sibling card; with an attached proposal it opens the proposal-aware dialog (branch `os/<change>`).
- [ ] **NEW** [session-card-spawn-worktree] A worktree spawn renders a placeholder-session-card under the parent repo folder group and replaces it in-slot at the top of the pinned group with no orphaned placeholder.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-card-spawn-sibling] session-card-spawn-sibling renders on live, ended (alongside Resume/Fork), and no-sessionFile cards; it is disabled with a changed tooltip when cwdMissing.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-card-spawn-sibling] Clicking session-card-spawn-sibling on a card with an attached proposal spawns with the parent's cwd and the proposal pre-attached.
- [ ] **NEW** [resume-error-banner] A failed resume renders a persistent resume-error-banner dismissible via resume-error-dismiss.
- [ ] **NEW** [dragHandleProps] Dragging an ended session card onto an alive card in the same folder triggers drag-to-resume; on failure resume-error-banner appears.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-activity-bar] A streaming session with in-flight bash toolCalls renders session-activity-bar with one session-activity-row per command showing command + elapsed time; it disappears when no tool is in flight, and absent for a session with no long-running processes.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-activity-stop] Clicking session-activity-stop on a session-activity-row calls abortToolCall to halt that tool run and removes the row.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-activity-overflow] With more than 2 in-flight bash rows, a session-activity-overflow "+N more" chip appears after 2 rows and lists the hidden commands in its title.
- [ ] **NEW** [background-drawer-chip] A session with background processes and no stored choice renders the drawer collapsed showing the `⚠ N background processes` summary row with the count.
- [ ] **NEW** [background-drawer-sheet] Toggling background-drawer-chip flips the drawer open optimistically and the open state persists across reload.
- [ ] **NEW** [background-drawer-sheet] A cross-client broadcast updates the background drawer collapsed state in an already-open dashboard.
- [ ] **NEW** [header-app-bar] The sidebar header renders header-app-bar (logo + settings-btn) and header-filter-bar as two distinct rows.
- [ ] **NEW** [settings-btn] Clicking settings-btn opens the settings/workspace resources surface.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-search-input] Typing in session-search-input filters cards by case-insensitive substring on the display name and renders folder-search-empty when nothing matches.
- [ ] **NEW** [workspace-filter-input] With a session-search-input query and empty workspace-filter-input, only pinned folders are searched until a workspace-filter value is entered.
- [ ] **NEW** [queue-count-badge] A session with queued prompts renders queue-count-badge showing the pending count.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-status-icon] session-status-icon shows solid green (active), pulsing yellow with animate-pulse (streaming), and gray (ended), conveying state via icon/shape not hue alone, with the source label as tooltip.
- [ ] **NEW** [state-pill] state-pill reflects the session's current status and updates live on server transitions without reload; ask_user shows "Needs you" (non-green dot), idle shows muted "Idle", IMPLEMENTING shows the change state label.
- [ ] **NEW** [worktree-pill] A session with gitWorktree set renders worktree-pill with worktree-pill-name showing the branch/worktree name once below the OpenSpec actions; a session without it renders no worktree-pill.
- [ ] **NEW** [git-init-btn] A non-git cwd renders git-init-btn; clicking it starts git init (opening an interactive session when there is no worktreeInit hook) — an initialized repo renders git-branch-btn instead.
- [ ] **NEW** [git-branch-btn] Clicking git-branch-btn opens the branch picker/switcher dialog.
- [ ] **NEW** [git-branch-btn] Dispatching git_head_update { branch: "develop" } updates git-branch-btn to "develop"; a folder HEAD entry overrides any worktree child branch, else it falls back to the session/fetched branch.
- [ ] **NEW** [OPENSPEC] An expanded card renders the OPENSPEC section collapsed by default; clicking its header toggles it open via onToggle.
- [ ] **NEW** [OPENSPEC] The OPENSPEC section lists changes grouped in-progress/completed with task counts and is hidden for projects with no openspec/ directory.
- [ ] **NEW** [OPENSPEC] Clicking an OpenSpec action button (Continue/FF/Apply) sends the corresponding command to the session.
- [ ] **NEW** [settings-btn] Toggling "Enable OpenSpec" hides the OPENSPEC subcard across cards and re-enabling restores it.
- [ ] **NEW** [SessionCard] Triggering activity for `openspec/changes/add-auth/...` auto-renames the card (worktree-pill-name shows `add-auth`) and marks it attached; a UUID-shaped path leaves the name unchanged and attached-proposal chip unset.
- [ ] **NEW** [SessionCard] A card renders subcard titles only for sections with content: MEMORY absent with no plugin claim, FLOWS absent with no flow claims.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-activity-bar] Running a flow renders the session-activity-bar / activity badge on the session card.
- [ ] **NEW** [SessionCard] A session with no custom name displays the directory basename (cwd.split("/").pop()); clicking the name region navigates to `/session/:id` and highlights it after reload.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-hide-btn] Clicking session-hide-btn removes the card from the default list and swaps in session-unhide-btn; with "Show hidden" the muted card's session-unhide-btn restores it, and neither navigates (stopPropagation).
- [ ] **NEW** [session-close-btn] Clicking session-close-btn dims the card and swaps ✕ for a spinner; a streaming session confirms first; re-clicking while closing is disabled; on timeout without session_removed it reverts and re-enables.
- [ ] **NEW** [session-close-btn] Closing removes only that session's card, leaves siblings, and transitions its session-status-icon to ended.
- [ ] **NEW** [SessionCard] On `session_removed` the card unmounts and disappears.
- [ ] **NEW** [folder-toggle-btn] Clicking folder-toggle-btn collapses/expands the folder's session group (header stays visible) and the collapsed state persists across reload.
- [ ] **NEW** [folder-toggle-btn] Clicking "+ New Session" on a collapsed folder expands it and shows the placeholder/new session card; the parent's "+ New Session" is disabled during an in-flight spawn.
- [ ] **NEW** [folder-ended-toggle-group] Each folder renders a collapsed `N ended` toggle below its alive sessions; clicking it expands the ended group and reveals the Hide ended toggle (folder-ended-toggle-top-group).
- [ ] **NEW** [placeholder-session-card] Clicking a group's spawn/New button renders placeholder-session-card at the top of that group, replaced when the real session registers; two spawns produce two distinct placeholders.
- [ ] **NEW** [drag-handle] Dragging the sidebar drag-handle resizes it, clamps within bounds, and persists across reload.
- [ ] **NEW** [sidebar-collapse] Clicking sidebar-collapse (on the ResizableSidebar edge, not the header toolbar) collapses to the narrow strip; sidebar-expand restores it, and the state survives reload.
- [ ] **NEW** [workspace-drag-handle-id] Dragging workspace-drag-handle-id reorders workspaces, emits `reorder_workspaces`, and persists after reload; the dragged workspace collapses during drag and restores its state on drop.
- [ ] **NEW** [folder-toggle-btn] Dragging a folder within a workspace reorders it, emits `reorder_workspace_folders`, and persists; dropping into another workspace is a no-op.
- [ ] **NEW** [sortable-pinned-group] Pinned folder groups render inside sortable-pinned-group with working dragHandleProps; dragging group A onto group B swaps order and persists.
- [ ] **NEW** [dragHandleProps] Dragging a session card by its handle reorders it within its folder group (without changing pinned-group order) and persists after reload; press-and-hold shows the grabbing cursor.
- [ ] **NEW** [sortable-pinned-group] A hovered workspace/folder/group drop slot shows a dashed accent outline while session slots show only slide feedback.
- [ ] **NEW** [workspace-name-id] A directory group header shows the full absolute path middle-truncated with `…`, preserving root prefix and trailing directory name.
- [ ] **NEW** [workspace-toggle-id] Clicking workspace-toggle-id collapses the workspace's folder rows and the collapsed state persists across reload; the header shows a pin toggle on the right.
- [ ] **NEW** [workspace-menu-id] WorkspaceHeader renders no add-folder pin icon; an expanded workspace body shows a full-width `+ Add Folder` button.
- [ ] **NEW** [folder-toggle-btn] A folder added to a workspace stays visible even when unpinned with zero sessions.
- [ ] **NEW** [sortable-pinned-group] An empty pinned directory group still renders editor buttons and a spawn/New button.
- [ ] **NEW** [InlineRenameInput] Double-clicking a session name opens the inline rename input; Enter confirms the new name, Escape restores the previous.
- [ ] **NEW** [mobile-card-attached-chip] On a mobile viewport subcard panels are hidden and mobile-card-attached-chip renders with per-letter (P/D/S/T) artifact status colors; detaching a proposal removes it, attaching a change to an unnamed session sets the title and shows it.
- [ ] **NEW** [folder-ended-toggle-group.cwd] After reconnect, no active session renders below the "Show N ended" divider toggle.
- [x] _COVERED_ [session-card-spawn-sibling] Clicking session-card-spawn-sibling spawns a new session in the folder's cwd and the card appears already attached after the round-trip.
- [x] _COVERED_ [git-branch-btn] A session in a git repo shows the branch indicator via git-branch-btn.

- [ ] **NEW** [pending-prompt-card] An `extension_ui_request` confirm renders an inline pending-prompt-card with confirm/cancel; resolving collapses it to a summary.
- [ ] **NEW** [pending-prompt-card] Enter on an ended session keeps the optimistic pending-prompt-card visible across resume→replay→first user_message and session_state_reset.
- [ ] **NEW** [pending-prompt-card] Pressing Stop/Esc during an in-flight resume clears the pending-prompt-card and re-enables the input.
- [ ] **NEW** [pending-steer-card] A mid-stream steer renders a STEERING ghost user bubble anchored after the streaming text; it survives refresh via replay and clicking ✕ removes it while the agent continues.
- [ ] **NEW** [ChatView] With both steer and follow-up queues empty, neither pending-steer-card nor pending-prompt-card renders.
- [ ] **NEW** [chat-view-modified-pill] After a per-session view override, chat-view-modified-pill appears; clicking "Use global settings" clears the override and removes the pill.
- [ ] **NEW** [chat-view-popover] Opening the ⚙ View menu renders chat-view-popover with all tool-call toggle rows on-screen, flipping upward near the viewport bottom.
- [ ] **NEW** [chat-view-popover] Hiding a tool call via the ChatView popover affects only the current session.

- [ ] **NEW** [MinimalChatView] On mobile width, pressing the header Back arrow navigates to the session-card list (`/`).
- [ ] **NEW** [MinimalChatView] Clicking Back from the markdown preview restores the hidden chat view.
- [ ] **NEW** [LinkifiedText] Output with `.pi/settings.json` renders one clickable link with the full path (no `.js` truncation, no stray `on`).
- [ ] **NEW** [LinkifiedText] A `javascript:`/`data:` URI in tool output is not rendered as a clickable link.
- [ ] **NEW** [LinkifiedText] Prose like `version 1.0.0` or `and/or` produces no false-positive file link.
- [x] _COVERED_ [reasoning-block] A live reasoning block stays expanded then auto-collapses after reasoningAutoCollapseMs; reload renders replayed blocks collapsed; reasoningAutoCollapseMs=0 keeps it open until clicked.
- [x] _COVERED_ [pending-prompt-card] Sending to an idle session shows an optimistic bubble that confirms with no leftover card; a mid-turn send shows a queue chip, not an optimistic bubble.
- [x] _COVERED_ [LinkifiedText] `src/foo.ts:42` renders an inline clickable OpenFile link and an http(s) URL renders `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`, drag-selectable and click-to-open.
