## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Folder actions menu replaces the header action cluster

The folder header SHALL expose exactly one trailing control: a folder actions menu trigger.

Every directory mutation that renders in the **header row** SHALL be reachable from that menu
and SHALL NOT also render as a standalone control in the header row.

This requirement is scoped to the header row. The slot pills' own action buttons live elsewhere
on the card, are outside its scope, and continue to render; consolidating those is the subject of
a separate change. The init and cleanup controls that formerly sat on `FolderActionBar` are no
longer an exception to anything: initialization renders in the tier-0 banner, and cleanup is an
item in this menu's `DIRECTORY` group.

**Accepted duplication.** The `AddToWorkspaceMenu` popover already offers its own
remove-from-workspace entry. After this change the gesture is reachable both from that popover
and from the folder actions menu's workspace group. Both SHALL continue to work and SHALL have
identical effect. This is a deliberate trade-off, not an oversight: collapsing it would require
reworking the popover, which this change does not touch.

Activating the trigger SHALL stop click propagation so it neither navigates to the directory
home page nor toggles the folder's collapsed state.

Menu open state SHALL be keyed per folder scope so opening one folder's menu never opens
another's.

#### Scenario: Cluster is a single control

- **WHEN** a folder header renders its trailing cluster
- **THEN** exactly one control SHALL render in the cluster
- **AND** the urgency-sort, pin, add-to-workspace, remove-from-workspace and directory-settings controls SHALL NOT render as separate cluster buttons

#### Scenario: Slot-pill controls are unaffected

- **WHEN** an expanded folder card renders while a slot pill holds its own action button
- **THEN** that control SHALL continue to render
- **AND** its presence SHALL NOT be treated as a violation of this requirement

#### Scenario: The card carries no separate init or cleanup row

- **WHEN** an expanded folder card renders
- **THEN** no action row SHALL render between the git row and the slot pills other than the tier-0 banner

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Menu carries a permanent Project setup item

The `DIRECTORY` group SHALL contain a permanently rendered `Project setup…` item with one stable label, regardless of the directory's setup state, so its position is learnable. The item SHALL display the per-artifact tally as `n/N`, including `5/5` for a fully set-up directory.

Division of labour: the **banner carries urgency**, the **menu carries availability**. A directory with no banner SHALL still expose this item.

The item SHALL carry a `● update` badge when init-status reports `setupOutdated === true`, and no badge when the field is absent or false.

#### Scenario: Item present on a fully configured directory

- **GIVEN** a directory whose checklist reports every artifact present
- **WHEN** the folder actions menu opens
- **THEN** the `DIRECTORY` group SHALL contain `Project setup… 5/5`

#### Scenario: Tally reflects partial state

- **GIVEN** a directory whose checklist reports 3 of 5 present
- **WHEN** the menu opens
- **THEN** the item SHALL read `Project setup… 3/5`

#### Scenario: Update badge is driven by setupOutdated

- **GIVEN** a directory reporting `setupOutdated: true`
- **WHEN** the menu opens
- **THEN** the item SHALL carry a `● update` badge

#### Scenario: Absent staleness field shows no badge

- **GIVEN** an init-status payload omitting `setupOutdated`
- **WHEN** the menu opens
- **THEN** the item SHALL carry no badge

### Requirement: Menu hosts the broken-session cleanup action

`Clean up broken (N)` SHALL render as an item in the `DIRECTORY` group, carrying the count of the folder's ended sessions whose directory is missing, and SHALL be absent when that count is zero. It SHALL NOT render in the tier-0 banner: it is housekeeping and does not block the folder.

The item SHALL carry test id `folder-menu-cleanup-broken-<cwd>`, superseding the card-level `folder-cleanup-broken-btn`.

The `DIRECTORY` group is used deliberately because it already exists; this requirement does not depend on any later change introducing a `MAINTENANCE` group.

#### Scenario: Cleanup appears in the menu when broken sessions exist

- **GIVEN** a folder with 3 ended sessions whose directories are missing
- **WHEN** the folder actions menu opens
- **THEN** the `DIRECTORY` group SHALL offer a cleanup item naming the count 3

#### Scenario: Cleanup is absent when nothing is broken

- **GIVEN** a folder with no broken sessions
- **WHEN** the menu opens
- **THEN** no cleanup item SHALL render
