## 1. Shared types + bridge detection

- [x] 1.1 Add `GitWorktreeInfo` interface to `packages/shared/src/types.ts` (`mainPath: string; name: string; base?: string`) and `gitWorktree?: GitWorktreeInfo` on `DashboardSession`
- [x] 1.2 Mirror the field on `GitInfo` in `packages/extension/src/vcs-info.ts` (`git-info.ts` was renamed in an earlier change)
- [x] 1.3 Implement `detectWorktree(cwd)` in `vcs-info.ts`: run `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` and `--show-toplevel` via new `commonDirOr` / `toplevelOr` recipes in `platform/git.ts`; return `{ mainPath, name }` when common-dir is outside top-level, else `undefined`
- [x] 1.4 Wire `detectWorktree` into `gatherGitInfo` and ensure failure of the rev-parse pair short-circuits to `undefined` (does NOT block branch / remote / PR detection)
- [x] 1.5 Unit tests for `detectWorktree`: main checkout (abs + rel commonDir), worktree, sibling-layout worktree, nested-cwd-not-worktree, rev-parse failure (mocked at platform layer)
- [x] 1.6 Forward `gitWorktree` on `git_info_update` payload (session_register itself does not carry git info; followup git_info_update covers both register and live update paths); add `lastGitWorktreeJson` change-detection cache to `BridgeContext` + sync wrappers

## 2. Server-side propagation + meta persistence

- [x] 2.1 Store `gitWorktree` on the in-memory `Session` model — already handled by `Object.assign` in `memory-session-manager.ts#update`; field added to `DashboardSession` in §1
- [x] 2.2 Forward `gitWorktree` on `session_added` / `session_updated` browser messages — already covered by generic `broadcastSessionUpdated(updates)` spread; `event-wiring.ts` now includes `gitUpdates.gitWorktree`
- [x] 2.3 Extend `.meta.json` writer to persist a new optional `gitWorktreeBase: string` field on `SessionMeta`
- [x] 2.4 Compose `gitWorktree.base` into browser payloads via new pure helper `composeWorktreePayload` in `packages/server/src/git-worktree-compose.ts`; wired into `event-wiring.ts#git_info_update`; `session-scanner.ts` loads `meta.gitWorktreeBase` onto `DashboardSession.gitWorktreeBase` (server-internal cache field)
- [x] 2.5 Backward-compat tests: 5 unit tests for `composeWorktreePayload` (undefined / null / wire-without-base / wire-with-base / cache-merge / immutability); 4 tests for `SessionMeta.gitWorktreeBase` round-trip incl. legacy-meta-file scenario

## 3. Pure helpers

- [ ] 3.1 Create `packages/server/src/git-worktree.ts` with pure `slugifyBranch(branch: string): string` matching the design's slug rule
- [ ] 3.2 Add pure `parsePorcelainWorktrees(stdout: string): WorktreeEntry[]` parser; first record SHALL be flagged `isMain: true`
- [ ] 3.3 Add pure `resolveDefaultBase(opts: { head: HeadInfo; localBranches: string[]; remoteBranches: string[] }): string | { error: "no_usable_base" }` implementing the fallback chain (current → develop → main → master)
- [ ] 3.4 Add pure `ensureWorktreeExcludeLine(existing: string): { content: string; appended: boolean }` for idempotent `.git/info/exclude` mutation
- [ ] 3.5 Unit tests for each helper (slug edge cases, porcelain fixtures incl. detached/bare/locked entries, fallback chain fork points, exclude idempotency)

## 4. Server endpoints

- [ ] 4.1 Add `readHead(cwd)` to `packages/server/src/git-operations.ts`; returns `{ branch, detached, sha }`
- [ ] 4.2 Add `listWorktrees(cwd)` to `git-operations.ts`; runs `git worktree list --porcelain`; calls `parsePorcelainWorktrees`
- [ ] 4.3 Add `addWorktree({ cwd, base, newBranch, path, force })` to `git-operations.ts`; performs path derivation, pre-flight existence check, `git worktree add` invocation, and exclude-line append; returns structured `{ path, branch }` or error code
- [ ] 4.4 Register `GET /api/git/head` in `packages/server/src/routes/git-routes.ts` (localhost-only, `safeRealpathSync` validation, stable error codes)
- [ ] 4.5 Register `GET /api/git/worktrees` in `git-routes.ts`
- [ ] 4.6 Register `POST /api/git/worktree` in `git-routes.ts`; on success, persist `gitWorktreeBase` to `.meta.json` immediately if a session is later spawned (deferred — see 6.x)
- [ ] 4.7 Integration tests for each endpoint using a tmpdir git repo: happy-path, not-a-repo, branch_in_use, path_exists, base_not_found, slug-derived paths, idempotent exclude append, exclude-write failure does NOT fail request

## 5. Client grouping + display

- [ ] 5.1 Extend `resolveSessionGroupPath` in `packages/client/src/lib/session-grouping.ts` with the new step 3 (`gitWorktree.mainPath`)
- [ ] 5.2 Extend `clusterByWorkspaceName` to also key on `gitWorktree?.name`; empty-key cluster sorts first; remaining keys alphabetical
- [ ] 5.3 Unit tests in `packages/client/src/lib/__tests__/session-grouping.test.ts`: worktree session under pinned parent groups correctly; explicit pin of worktree wins; jj+worktree both present → jj wins; cluster adjacency preserved with server-provided ordering
- [ ] 5.4 Add `WorktreePill` rendering inside `WorkspaceSubcard.tsx` (or equivalent), guarded by `session.gitWorktree`; pill text `worktree`, `data-testid="worktree-pill"`, `title` as specified
- [ ] 5.5 Component tests: pill renders when `gitWorktree` present; absent otherwise; tooltip text reflects `base` presence; mobile branch never renders pill

## 6. Worktree dialog

- [ ] 6.1 Add client fetch helpers to `packages/client/src/lib/git-api.ts`: `getHead`, `listWorktrees`, `createWorktree`
- [ ] 6.2 Create `packages/client/src/components/WorktreeSpawnDialog.tsx` composing `BranchPicker` + path preview; layout: existing-worktrees list (top), divider, create form (bottom)
- [ ] 6.3 On mount, fetch `getHead` + `listWorktrees` in parallel; compute default base via the client-side equivalent of `resolveDefaultBase` (the helper is shared by the server, see 3.3; expose a client-safe path if needed)
- [ ] 6.4 Existing-worktrees list: each row clickable; on select, immediately call spawn action (no second confirmation) with the worktree's path as cwd; close dialog
- [ ] 6.5 Create form: base picker, new-branch input (required, live slug preview shown as path under the input), path field (editable, defaults to derived); submit → `createWorktree` → spawn on returned path → close
- [ ] 6.6 Render structured errors inline (path_exists / branch_in_use / no_usable_base map to actionable messages); other codes surface stderr verbatim in a collapsed area
- [ ] 6.7 Show footnote when the repo has submodules: "submodules will not be initialized in the new worktree"
- [ ] 6.8 Component tests: existing-worktree row spawn, create-mode happy path, slug preview reactivity, error-inline rendering, footnote conditional

## 7. Action-bar integration

- [ ] 7.1 Add `+Worktree` button to `FolderActionBar.tsx` in the second slot (between `+Session` and `Terminals`)
- [ ] 7.2 Hide the button when no session under the folder has a `gitBranch` and the folder is not on the editor-detection git allowlist (i.e. the folder is not a git repo)
- [ ] 7.3 Hide the button on non-loopback access (match existing remote-hide pattern for the action bar)
- [ ] 7.4 Wire the button's `onClick` to open `WorktreeSpawnDialog` with the folder's cwd
- [ ] 7.5 Component tests: button visible on git folder, hidden on non-git folder, hidden on remote

## 8. Auto-spawn wiring

- [ ] 8.1 After the dialog calls `createWorktree`, invoke the existing spawn action with `cwd = <new worktree path>` and propagate `base` through a new spawn-options field `gitWorktreeBase` so the server can persist it to `.meta.json` on session creation
- [ ] 8.2 Server: on `spawn` actions carrying `gitWorktreeBase`, write that field to the session's `.meta.json` before bridge attaches
- [ ] 8.3 End-to-end test (server + client): dialog create → spawn → resulting session has `gitWorktree.base` populated in its `session_added` payload

## 9. Supersede prior changes

- [ ] 9.1 Add a top-of-file note in `openspec/changes/worktree-awareness/proposal.md`: "**Superseded by `add-worktree-spawn-dialog`**" with a one-line summary of why (different card-display decision, no grouping fix)
- [ ] 9.2 Same note in `openspec/changes/workspace-actions/proposal.md`: "**Superseded by `add-worktree-spawn-dialog`**" (different layout, narrower scope)
- [ ] 9.3 Move both superseded change directories to `openspec/changes/archive/superseded/` (preserve their artifacts; they were never implemented so no spec merge is needed)
- [ ] 9.4 Confirm `openspec list` no longer shows `worktree-awareness` or `workspace-actions` in the active list

## 10. Documentation

- [ ] 10.1 Add a row to `docs/file-index-server.md` for the new `git-worktree.ts` helper (caveman style, path-alphabetical)
- [ ] 10.2 Add a row to `docs/file-index-client.md` for `WorktreeSpawnDialog.tsx` (caveman style)
- [ ] 10.3 Update existing rows for `git-operations.ts` / `git-routes.ts` to mention the new endpoints (one-line append; do not pad)
- [ ] 10.4 Update existing rows for `git-info.ts` / `session-grouping.ts` to mention worktree fields and precedence step 3
- [ ] 10.5 Mention the new `.worktrees/` layout convention in `docs/architecture.md` (one short paragraph under git workflow / repo conventions)

## 11. Validation

- [ ] 11.1 Run `openspec validate --change add-worktree-spawn-dialog --strict`
- [ ] 11.2 Run full test suite (`npm test`); ensure all new tests pass and no existing tests regress
- [ ] 11.3 Manual smoke test on a real repo: open dialog, see main + any existing worktrees listed; create a new worktree from `develop`; confirm session card renders worktree pill; confirm session groups under parent pinned dir
- [ ] 11.4 Cross-platform check: same smoke test on Windows (path separators in derived paths, exclude file)
