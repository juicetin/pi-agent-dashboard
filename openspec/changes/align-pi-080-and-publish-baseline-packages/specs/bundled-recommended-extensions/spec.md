## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Recommended manifest membership reflects first-party defaults
The `RECOMMENDED_EXTENSIONS` constant in `packages/shared/src/recommended-extensions.ts` SHALL enumerate the pi extensions the dashboard team promotes as defaults, and each entry's `source` SHALL match the published/installable artifact that satisfies it.

#### Scenario: Curated additions present
- **WHEN** the manifest is evaluated at release time
- **THEN** it SHALL contain entries for `context-mode` (status `strongly-suggested`), `pi-hermes-memory`, `@ricoyudog/pi-goal-hermes`, `@blackbelt-technology/pi-model-proxy`, and `pi-simplify`, in addition to the pre-existing required/strongly-suggested entries

#### Scenario: Source field matches the satisfying artifact
- **WHEN** an entry declares a `source`
- **THEN** that `source` SHALL resolve to the artifact that `sourcesMatch()` recognizes as satisfying the entry — specifically image-fit SHALL use `npm:@blackbelt-technology/pi-image-fit-extension` and pi-flows SHALL use `npm:@blackbelt-technology/pi-flows`

#### Scenario: pi-flows stays out of the bundled set
- **WHEN** pi-flows `source` is switched to the npm spec
- **THEN** `pi-flows` SHALL NOT be added to `BUNDLED_EXTENSION_IDS` until upstream declares an SPDX-conformant license

#### Scenario: Manifest-shape test updated
- **WHEN** entries are added or their `source` changes
- **THEN** the manifest-shape test(s) in `packages/shared/src/__tests__/` SHALL assert the new membership and pass

### Requirement: Recommended-extension external requirements are declared and probed
`RecommendedExtension` SHALL support an optional `requires` declaration (`piExtensions` / `binaries` / `services`), and the recommended route SHALL surface a live probe result per requirement.

#### Scenario: requires declared and probed
- **WHEN** a recommended entry declares `requires` (e.g. `pi-agent-browser` binary `agent-browser`)
- **THEN** `GET /api/packages/recommended` SHALL return a structured probe (`{ name, satisfied }` per category) computed with the same probe used for dashboard-plugin `requires`, and `RecommendedExtensions.tsx` SHALL render satisfied/missing state

#### Scenario: native npm deps are NOT declared as requires
- **WHEN** an extension's only external dependency is a native npm module it bundles (e.g. hermes → `better-sqlite3`)
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT declare that module under `requires.binaries` — a bundled native dep is not a user-provided system requirement

#### Scenario: unknown service names are not declared
- **WHEN** an extension's external requirement is a service absent from the closed probe registry (e.g. a Honcho server)
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT declare that name under `requires.services` (it would always report unsatisfied); the need is surfaced via the companion dashboard plugin instead
