## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Health endpoint
The dashboard server SHALL expose a `GET /api/health` endpoint that returns server liveness information including process ID and uptime.

#### Scenario: Health check response
- **WHEN** a `GET /api/health` request is received
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ ok: true, pid: <number>, uptime: <seconds> }`

#### Scenario: Health check from localhost
- **WHEN** a `GET /api/health` request is received from any origin
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond successfully (no localhost guard on health endpoint)
