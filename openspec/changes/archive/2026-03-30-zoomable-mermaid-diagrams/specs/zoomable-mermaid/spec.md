## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Zoom interaction
The MermaidBlock component SHALL support zooming via mouse wheel scroll and pinch-to-zoom gestures. Zoom SHALL be centered on the cursor/pinch midpoint. Zoom scale SHALL be bounded between 0.5× and 4×.

#### Scenario: Mouse wheel zoom in
- **WHEN** the user scrolls the mouse wheel up over a Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL zoom in, centered on the cursor position

#### Scenario: Mouse wheel zoom out
- **WHEN** the user scrolls the mouse wheel down over a Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL zoom out, centered on the cursor position

#### Scenario: Pinch-to-zoom on touch
- **WHEN** the user performs a two-finger pinch gesture on a Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL zoom in or out centered on the pinch midpoint

#### Scenario: Zoom at maximum scale
- **WHEN** the diagram is at 4× scale and the user attempts to zoom in further
- **THEN** the scale SHALL remain at 4× (no further zoom)

#### Scenario: Zoom at minimum scale
- **WHEN** the diagram is at 0.5× scale and the user attempts to zoom out further
- **THEN** the scale SHALL remain at 0.5× (no further zoom)

### Requirement: Pan interaction
The MermaidBlock component SHALL support panning via click-and-drag (mouse) and single-finger drag (touch when zoomed). The diagram SHALL use CSS `transform` for positioning.

#### Scenario: Click-drag to pan
- **WHEN** the user clicks and drags on a Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL pan following the drag direction

#### Scenario: Touch drag to pan
- **WHEN** the user performs a single-finger drag on a zoomed Mermaid diagram on a touch device
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL pan following the drag direction

### Requirement: Zoom control buttons
The MermaidBlock component SHALL display overlay control buttons for zoom in (+), zoom out (−), and reset (fit to container).

#### Scenario: Zoom in button
- **WHEN** the user clicks the zoom-in (+) button
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL zoom in by a fixed step (e.g., 1.2× multiplier)

#### Scenario: Zoom out button
- **WHEN** the user clicks the zoom-out (−) button
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL zoom out by a fixed step

#### Scenario: Reset button
- **WHEN** the user clicks the reset button
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL return to its initial scale and position (fit to container)

#### Scenario: Double-click to reset
- **WHEN** the user double-clicks on the diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL reset to its initial scale and position

#### Scenario: Control button visibility when focused
- **WHEN** a Mermaid diagram is focused (clicked by the user)
- **THEN** zoom control buttons SHALL be displayed overlaid on the diagram container

#### Scenario: Control buttons hidden when unfocused
- **WHEN** a Mermaid diagram is not focused
- **THEN** zoom control buttons SHALL NOT be displayed

### Requirement: Click-to-activate focus model
Zoom and pan interactions SHALL only be active when the user has clicked the diagram to focus it. When unfocused, scroll and touch events SHALL pass through to the page normally.

#### Scenario: Click to focus
- **WHEN** the user clicks on an unfocused Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL enter focused state with a visible focus indicator (blue border) and enable zoom/pan interactions

#### Scenario: Click outside to deactivate
- **WHEN** the user clicks outside a focused Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL exit focused state and zoom/pan interactions SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: Escape to deactivate
- **WHEN** the user presses Escape while a Mermaid diagram is focused
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL exit focused state

#### Scenario: Hover hint when unfocused
- **WHEN** the user hovers over an unfocused Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** a "Click to zoom & pan" hint SHALL appear

#### Scenario: Scroll passthrough when unfocused
- **WHEN** the user scrolls over an unfocused Mermaid diagram
- **THEN** the page SHALL scroll normally without zooming the diagram

### Requirement: Wide bubble layout
Chat bubbles containing Mermaid diagrams SHALL expand to 95% of the content area width to give diagrams more room.

#### Scenario: Desktop wide bubble
- **WHEN** an assistant message contains a Mermaid diagram on desktop
- **THEN** the chat bubble SHALL be forced to 95% width instead of the default 80% max-width

#### Scenario: Mobile layout
- **WHEN** an assistant message contains a Mermaid diagram on mobile
- **THEN** the chat bubble SHALL use 95% width (consistent with desktop)

### Requirement: Viewport containment
The MermaidBlock component SHALL clip the diagram within a fixed-height viewport container with `overflow: hidden` so that zoomed/panned content does not spill outside.

#### Scenario: Zoomed diagram clipping
- **WHEN** the diagram is zoomed in beyond the viewport bounds
- **THEN** portions outside the viewport SHALL be clipped (not visible)

#### Scenario: Default viewport height
- **WHEN** a Mermaid diagram is rendered
- **THEN** the viewport SHALL have a reasonable default height that shows the diagram without excessive whitespace
