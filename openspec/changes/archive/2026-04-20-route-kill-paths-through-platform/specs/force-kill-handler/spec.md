## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Force kill process escalation
When the server receives a `force_kill` message, it SHALL terminate the session's process using the platform-provided `killProcess(pid, { timeoutMs: 2000 })` helper so that the entire process subtree is terminated on every supported OS. On Windows this delegates to `taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>` (immediate tree kill). On POSIX this sends `SIGTERM`, waits up to 2 seconds, and sends `SIGKILL` if the process is still alive. The server SHALL NOT call `process.kill(pid, …)` directly.

#### Scenario: Windows tree kill via taskkill
- **WHEN** the server handles a `force_kill` on `process.platform === "win32"` for a session with a known PID
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `killProcess(pid, { timeoutMs: 2000 })` from `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/platform/process.js`
- **AND** the platform helper SHALL execute `taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>` so that descendant processes (tmux panes, `wt` tabs, pi child binaries) are also terminated

#### Scenario: POSIX SIGTERM sent first
- **WHEN** the server handles a `force_kill` on `process.platform === "linux"` or `"darwin"` for a session with a known PID
- **THEN** `killProcess` SHALL send `SIGTERM` to the PID first

#### Scenario: POSIX SIGKILL after timeout
- **WHEN** `killProcess` has sent `SIGTERM` AND the process is still alive after 2 seconds
- **THEN** `killProcess` SHALL send `SIGKILL` to the PID
- **AND** return `{ ok: true, forced: true }`

#### Scenario: Process already dead after SIGTERM
- **WHEN** `killProcess` has sent `SIGTERM` AND the process exits within 2 seconds
- **THEN** `killProcess` SHALL NOT send `SIGKILL`
- **AND** return `{ ok: true, forced: false }`

#### Scenario: No PID available
- **WHEN** a `force_kill` is received for a session with no stored PID
- **THEN** the server SHALL force-close the bridge WebSocket connection
- **AND** return `force_kill_result` with `success: true` and a message indicating WS-only kill

#### Scenario: No direct process.kill in the handler
- **WHEN** the repo-level enforcement test scans `packages/server/src/browser-handlers/session-action-handler.ts`
- **THEN** no `process.kill(` call SHALL be present
- **AND** all termination SHALL go through `killProcess` or `killPidWithGroup`
