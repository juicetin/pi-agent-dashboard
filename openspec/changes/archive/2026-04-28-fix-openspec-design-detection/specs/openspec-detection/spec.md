## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Local design evidence promotes the design artifact status

The dashboard SHALL post-process the per-change `artifacts` array returned
by `openspec status --change <name> --json` so that the `design` artifact's
`status` is promoted from `"ready"` to `"done"` when local file-system
evidence indicates design work is satisfied. The override MUST NOT alter
any other artifact id, MUST NOT demote `"done"` to any other value, and
MUST NOT promote `"blocked"` directly to `"done"`.

#### Scenario: design.md present satisfies design

- **WHEN** the change directory contains a file named `design.md`
- **THEN** `artifacts[design].status` SHALL be `"done"` regardless of the
  CLI's verdict for that artifact.

#### Scenario: split design files satisfy design

- **WHEN** the change directory contains one or more files matching the
  regex `^design.*\.md$` (e.g. `design-rendering.md`, `design-state.md`,
  `design.draft.md`) AND no literal `design.md`
- **THEN** `artifacts[design].status` SHALL be promoted from `"ready"` to
  `"done"`.

#### Scenario: design directory satisfies design

- **WHEN** the change directory contains a `design/` subdirectory holding
  at least one `*.md` file AND no literal `design.md`
- **THEN** `artifacts[design].status` SHALL be promoted from `"ready"` to
  `"done"`.

#### Scenario: tasks with checkboxes satisfies design

- **WHEN** the change directory contains a `tasks.md` file whose contents
  include at least one Markdown checkbox line (matching
  `^\s*-\s+\[[ xX]\]\s`) AND none of the design-file rules apply
- **THEN** `artifacts[design].status` SHALL be promoted from `"ready"` to
  `"done"`.

#### Scenario: empty tasks.md does not satisfy design

- **WHEN** the change directory contains a `tasks.md` file with no
  checkbox lines AND no design files or directory
- **THEN** `artifacts[design].status` SHALL remain unchanged from the CLI
  verdict.

#### Scenario: blocked design artifact is never promoted

- **WHEN** the CLI reports `artifacts[design].status === "blocked"`
- **THEN** the override SHALL NOT promote it to `"done"` regardless of
  local evidence.

#### Scenario: only design artifact may be mutated

- **WHEN** the override evaluates a change
- **THEN** the `status` of every artifact other than `design` SHALL be
  passed through unchanged from the CLI verdict.

### Requirement: Change-level isComplete agrees with overridden artifacts

After the design-artifact override is applied, the dashboard SHALL
re-derive the change-level `isComplete` flag so that it reflects the
post-override artifact statuses. The override MUST NOT demote a CLI
`isComplete: true` to false.

#### Scenario: all artifacts done after override

- **WHEN** every artifact in the post-override `artifacts` array has
  `status === "done"`
- **THEN** `isComplete` SHALL be `true`.

#### Scenario: at least one artifact not done after override

- **WHEN** any artifact in the post-override `artifacts` array has
  `status !== "done"`
- **THEN** `isComplete` SHALL be the value reported by the CLI (no
  promotion to true).

#### Scenario: CLI reports isComplete true

- **WHEN** the CLI returns `isComplete: true` for the change
- **THEN** the override SHALL NOT change that value to false under any
  circumstances.

### Requirement: Detection logic is shared between dashboard and skills

The system SHALL evaluate OpenSpec artifact status through a single shared module so that the dashboard's `buildOpenSpecData` post-processor and the OpenSpec workflow skills (`openspec-continue-change`, `openspec-ff-change`, `openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-verify-change`) cannot disagree about a change's next-ready artifact.

#### Scenario: shared module is the single source of truth

- **WHEN** the dashboard polls `openspec status --json` for a change
- **AND** an OpenSpec skill probes the same change in the same instant
- **THEN** both consumers SHALL produce the same per-artifact `status`
  values for that change, having both invoked the shared
  `evaluateLocalDesignSatisfaction` helper.

#### Scenario: skills invoke the shared helper script

- **WHEN** any OpenSpec workflow skill needs to determine the next-ready
  artifact for a change
- **THEN** the skill SHALL invoke
  `.pi/skills/openspec-shared/scripts/effective-status.sh <change>`
  rather than calling `openspec status --change <change> --json`
  directly.

#### Scenario: repo-lint blocks raw status calls in OpenSpec skills

- **WHEN** an OpenSpec skill SKILL.md file under `.pi/skills/openspec-*`
  contains a literal invocation of `openspec status --json` outside a
  documentation example
- **THEN** the repository test suite SHALL fail with a citation of the
  offending file and line.

### Requirement: Override is pure and probe-injectable

The override logic SHALL be a pure function of its inputs (the CLI's
parsed status output and a file-system probe interface). The probe
SHALL be injectable so that unit tests can exercise the full rule
matrix without filesystem mocking or temporary directories.

#### Scenario: production callers inject a real fs probe

- **WHEN** `pollOpenSpec` (sync) or `pollOpenSpecAsync` (async) call
  `buildOpenSpecData`
- **THEN** they SHALL pass a probe whose methods read from the real
  filesystem rooted at `<cwd>/openspec/changes/<name>/`.

#### Scenario: tests inject an in-memory probe

- **WHEN** unit tests exercise `buildOpenSpecData` or
  `evaluateLocalDesignSatisfaction`
- **THEN** they SHALL pass an in-memory probe stub returning fixture
  values, without touching the filesystem.

#### Scenario: missing probe falls back to CLI verbatim

- **WHEN** `buildOpenSpecData` is called without an `fsProbe` argument
- **THEN** every artifact status and the change-level `isComplete` flag
  SHALL equal the CLI verdict, preserving today's behavior for any
  caller that has not yet been wired to inject a probe.
