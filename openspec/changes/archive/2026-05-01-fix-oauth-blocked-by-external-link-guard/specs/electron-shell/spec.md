## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: External links open in the system browser, not a secondary Electron window
The main `BrowserWindow` created by `createMainWindow` SHALL route every external URL initiated **from the dashboard origin** to the user's system browser via `shell.openExternal`, and SHALL never allow an external URL to (a) replace the dashboard in the main window or (b) spawn a secondary Electron `BrowserWindow`. An external URL is any URL whose origin differs from the server origin the main window was loaded with.

This requirement applies to both navigation triggers Electron exposes:
- `target="_blank"` anchors and `window.open` calls (intercepted via `webContents.setWindowOpenHandler`) — routed through `shell.openExternal` regardless of which page issued the call (correct for both chat-content links and OAuth device-code verification URIs).
- Full-window navigations (intercepted via `webContents.on("will-navigate", ...)`) — the decision is **current-origin-aware**: only navigations that *leave the dashboard* are intercepted. Navigation that originates from a non-dashboard page (e.g. an OAuth provider's login flow currently displayed in the BrowserWindow) SHALL proceed without interception so multi-step authentication can complete.

Same-origin URLs (including relative paths, in-document fragments, and query-only differences) SHALL continue to navigate normally within the main window so that the dashboard's own routing and the `/auth/login?return=...` redirect flow keep working.

#### Scenario: target=_blank link in dashboard content
- **WHEN** the user clicks an anchor with `target="_blank"` (or JavaScript calls `window.open`) pointing at an external URL
- **THEN** the Electron shell SHALL call `shell.openExternal(url)` and return `{ action: "deny" }` from `setWindowOpenHandler` so no secondary `BrowserWindow` is created

#### Scenario: Bare anchor clicked, external URL (when on the dashboard)
- **WHEN** the user clicks an anchor without `target="_blank"` whose href resolves to a different origin than the server origin
- **AND** `webContents.getURL()` returns a URL whose origin equals the captured server origin (the user is currently on the dashboard)
- **THEN** the `will-navigate` handler SHALL call `event.preventDefault()` and `shell.openExternal(url)`
- **AND** the main window SHALL remain on the dashboard

#### Scenario: Same-origin navigation proceeds
- **WHEN** the user (or a client-side redirect) navigates to a same-origin URL such as `/auth/login?return=/`
- **THEN** the `will-navigate` handler SHALL NOT call `event.preventDefault()`
- **AND** the main window SHALL perform the navigation as usual

#### Scenario: Malformed href
- **WHEN** the navigation target cannot be parsed as a URL
- **THEN** the `will-navigate` handler SHALL treat it as if `decideWillNavigate` returned `"open-external"` (i.e. `event.preventDefault()` plus `shell.openExternal(url)`, which the OS / Electron filters by scheme)

#### Scenario: Mid-flight OAuth / OIDC navigation is not intercepted
- **WHEN** `webContents` emits `will-navigate` AND `webContents.getURL()` returns a URL whose origin is **not** the dashboard origin (e.g. the user is mid-login on `accounts.google.com`, `github.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`, or any OAuth provider that the dashboard's `/auth/start/:provider` redirected them to)
- **THEN** the guard SHALL allow the navigation to proceed unchanged — it SHALL NOT call `event.preventDefault()` and SHALL NOT call `shell.openExternal`
- **AND** this includes provider-internal navigation (provider → provider), provider → dashboard callback redirects (`provider → http://<dashboard>/auth/callback/...`), and provider → third-party identity-broker navigations
- **AND** the eventual redirect back to the dashboard origin SHALL land in the BrowserWindow normally; no special handling is required because the resulting `will-navigate` (if it fires) is itself same-origin under the dashboard branch

#### Scenario: Same-origin SPA navigation unaffected
- **WHEN** the React app performs a `pushState` or hash route change within the dashboard origin
- **THEN** `will-navigate` SHALL NOT fire and the navigation SHALL succeed (this is Electron's documented behavior for `will-navigate`; the guard does not need to special-case it)

#### Scenario: will-navigate decision helper exists and is unit-tested
- **WHEN** a developer needs to decide whether a `will-navigate` event should be allowed, intercepted, or cancelled
- **THEN** they SHALL use the pure helper `decideWillNavigate(serverOrigin, currentUrl, targetUrl) → "allow" | "open-external" | "cancel"` exported from `packages/electron/src/lib/link-handling.ts`
- **AND** that helper SHALL be covered by unit tests for: same-origin navigation on the dashboard (allow), external target on the dashboard (open-external), provider-internal navigation while not on the dashboard (allow), provider → dashboard callback (allow), provider → third-party identity broker (allow), unparseable current URL (fall back to leaving-dashboard rules), unparseable server origin (fail closed → cancel)

#### Scenario: Decision helper fail-closes on unparseable server origin
- **WHEN** `decideWillNavigate` is called with a `serverOrigin` argument that cannot be parsed as a URL
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `"cancel"` (the caller MUST `event.preventDefault()` without opening anything externally)
- **AND** this protects against a configuration error in `serverUrl` from accidentally allowing arbitrary external navigation
