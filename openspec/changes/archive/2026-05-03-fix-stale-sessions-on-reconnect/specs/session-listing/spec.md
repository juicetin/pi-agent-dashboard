## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions snapshot replaces client state atomically

The browser message handler (`useMessageHandler`) SHALL handle `sessions_snapshot` by REPLACING both the `sessions` Map and the `sessionOrderMap` Map with the payload contents. It SHALL NOT merge with existing state.

After replacement, ids that were present in the previous `sessions` Map but are absent from `payload.sessions` SHALL no longer be in `sessions`. Cwds that were present in the previous `sessionOrderMap` but are absent from `payload.orders` SHALL no longer be in `sessionOrderMap`.

#### Scenario: Stale session is dropped on snapshot
- **GIVEN** the client has `sessions` containing id "stale-x" with status "active" from a previous server lifetime
- **WHEN** a `sessions_snapshot` arrives whose `sessions` array does NOT include id "stale-x"
- **THEN** after the message is processed, `sessions.has("stale-x")` SHALL be `false`

#### Scenario: Snapshot replaces sessionOrderMap completely
- **GIVEN** the client has `sessionOrderMap` with entry `{ "/repoA": ["a","b"] }` from a previous server lifetime
- **WHEN** a `sessions_snapshot` arrives with `orders: { "/repoB": ["c"] }`
- **THEN** after the message is processed, `sessionOrderMap.get("/repoA")` SHALL be `undefined`
- **AND** `sessionOrderMap.get("/repoB")` SHALL equal `["c"]`

#### Scenario: Snapshot does not silently merge over fresh ids
- **GIVEN** the snapshot payload contains an updated `DashboardSession` for id "live-y" with status "ended"
- **WHEN** the client previously had id "live-y" with status "active"
- **THEN** after processing, `sessions.get("live-y").status` SHALL equal `"ended"`
