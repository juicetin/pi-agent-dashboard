## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Reducer tracks in-flight retry state

The event reducer SHALL maintain a `retryState` field on `SessionState` describing the current LLM-provider retry phase. The field SHALL be set on `auto_retry_start` and cleared on `auto_retry_end`, `agent_start`, and `agent_end`.

The shape SHALL be:
```ts
retryState?: {
  attempt: number;       // 1-based attempt number
  maxAttempts: number;   // total attempts pi-coding-agent will make
  delayMs: number;       // milliseconds between this attempt and the next
  reason: string;        // errorMessage that triggered this retry
  startedAt: number;     // event.timestamp at auto_retry_start
}
```

#### Scenario: auto_retry_start sets retryState
- **WHEN** an `auto_retry_start` event arrives with `data: { attempt: 1, maxAttempts: 3, delayMs: 2000, errorMessage: "rate limit exceeded" }`
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL equal `{ attempt: 1, maxAttempts: 3, delayMs: 2000, reason: "rate limit exceeded", startedAt: <event.timestamp> }`
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: auto_retry_end with success clears retryState
- **WHEN** `retryState` is set
- **AND** an `auto_retry_end` event arrives with `data: { success: true, attempt: 2 }`
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL be cleared to undefined
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: auto_retry_end with failure clears retryState and surfaces error early
- **WHEN** `retryState` is set
- **AND** an `auto_retry_end` event arrives with `data: { success: false, attempt: 3, finalError: "Rate limit exceeded" }`
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` is currently undefined
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL be cleared
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` SHALL be set to `{ message: "Rate limit exceeded", timestamp: <event.timestamp> }`

#### Scenario: auto_retry_end after lastError already set
- **WHEN** `auto_retry_end` arrives with `success: false` and a `finalError`
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` is already set (e.g. by an earlier `agent_end`)
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL be cleared
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` SHALL NOT be overwritten

#### Scenario: agent_start defensively clears stale retryState
- **WHEN** `retryState` is set (e.g. session reload mid-retry)
- **AND** an `agent_start` event arrives
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL be cleared to undefined

#### Scenario: agent_end defensively clears retryState
- **WHEN** `retryState` is set
- **AND** an `agent_end` event arrives
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL be cleared after the existing `lastError` extraction logic runs

#### Scenario: auto_retry_end ignored when retryState is undefined
- **WHEN** `SessionState.retryState` is undefined
- **AND** an `auto_retry_end` event arrives
- **THEN** `SessionState.retryState` SHALL remain undefined
- **AND** `SessionState.lastError` SHALL NOT be modified by this event

### Requirement: Retry banner in chat view

The `ChatView` component SHALL render a `<RetryBanner>` above the input area when `SessionState.retryState` is set. Banner colors SHALL be visually distinct from the existing red `ErrorBanner` (amber/yellow palette).

The banner SHALL display:
- The retry phrasing. When `retryState.maxAttempts > 0` AND `retryState.delayMs > 0`, the phrasing SHALL include current attempt and max attempts plus a live countdown to `startedAt + delayMs`, refreshed at least once per second, never going below 0. When either is `<= 0` (sentinel — indeterminate retry; bridge does not know pi's retry settings), the banner SHALL show an indeterminate "retrying…" message instead.
- A "Stop retrying" button that triggers the same `abort` flow as the main Stop button.
- The original `reason` string, truncated to a single line with overflow ellipsis.

#### Scenario: Banner visible during retry with known countdown
- **WHEN** `retryState = { attempt: 2, maxAttempts: 3, delayMs: 4000, reason: "rate limit exceeded", startedAt: 1700000000000 }`
- **THEN** the banner SHALL be visible in `ChatView`
- **AND** the banner SHALL include text identifying attempt 2 of 3
- **AND** a "Stop retrying" button SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: Banner shows indeterminate state when delayMs is sentinel -1
- **WHEN** `retryState = { attempt: 1, maxAttempts: -1, delayMs: -1, reason: "rate limit exceeded", startedAt: 0 }`
- **THEN** the banner SHALL be visible
- **AND** the banner SHALL show "retrying…" without a countdown
- **AND** a "Stop retrying" button SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: Banner countdown reaches zero and stays
- **WHEN** the banner is mounted with `startedAt + delayMs` already elapsed AND `delayMs > 0`
- **THEN** the displayed countdown SHALL be `0` (not negative)
- **AND** the banner SHALL remain visible until `retryState` is cleared

#### Scenario: Stop retrying button triggers abort
- **GIVEN** the retry banner is visible
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Stop retrying"
- **THEN** an `abort` message SHALL be sent for the current session
- **AND** the banner SHALL clear once `retryState` is cleared (typically within ≤200ms via the bridge's synthetic auto_retry_end)

#### Scenario: Banner clears on auto_retry_end
- **GIVEN** the retry banner is visible
- **WHEN** an `auto_retry_end` event arrives (success or failure)
- **THEN** the banner SHALL no longer render

### Requirement: Session card amber dot during retry

A session card in the sidebar SHALL render an amber pulsing status dot when its `SessionState.retryState` is set AND `SessionState.lastError` is undefined. This visual SHALL be distinct from the existing red error dot and the default idle/streaming/ended dots.

#### Scenario: Amber dot during retry
- **WHEN** the session has `retryState` set and `lastError` is undefined
- **THEN** the session card status dot SHALL be amber and pulsing

#### Scenario: Red error dot wins over amber
- **WHEN** the session has both `retryState` set AND `lastError` set
- **THEN** the session card status dot SHALL be red (lastError takes precedence)

#### Scenario: Dot returns to default after retry clears
- **WHEN** `retryState` is cleared (success or failure)
- **AND** `lastError` is undefined
- **THEN** the session card status dot SHALL return to its non-error default

### Requirement: Bridge synthesizes auto_retry_start from observed message_end

The bridge SHALL maintain a per-session retry tracker. When pi emits `message_end` whose `message.role === "assistant"` AND `message.stopReason === "error"` AND `message.errorMessage` matches the pi-coding-agent retryable pattern (`overloaded`, `rate.?limit`, `too many requests`, `429`, `5\d\d`, `service.?unavailable`, `network.?error`, `connection.?error`, `connection.?(refused|lost)`, `fetch failed`, `socket hang up`, `terminated`, `timeout`, `retry delay` etc.), the bridge SHALL forward an additional synthesized `event_forward` with `eventType: "auto_retry_start"` and `data: { attempt: <1-based counter>, maxAttempts: -1, delayMs: -1, errorMessage: <observed errorMessage> }`. The synthesized event SHALL be forwarded immediately after the original `message_end`. The session SHALL be marked as in retry until cleared.

`maxAttempts: -1` and `delayMs: -1` are sentinels: pi does not expose its retry settings to extensions, so the dashboard SHALL render an indeterminate "retrying…" UI instead of a countdown.

#### Scenario: Retryable assistant error triggers synthesized auto_retry_start
- **WHEN** the bridge forwards a `message_end` with `message: { role: "assistant", stopReason: "error", errorMessage: "rate limit exceeded" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL also forward an `event_forward` with `event.eventType === "auto_retry_start"`
- **AND** the synthesized event SHALL have `data.attempt >= 1`, `data.maxAttempts === -1`, `data.delayMs === -1`, `data.errorMessage === "rate limit exceeded"`

#### Scenario: Non-retryable assistant error does NOT synthesize
- **WHEN** the bridge forwards a `message_end` with `errorMessage: "prompt is too long: 300000 tokens > 200000 maximum"` (context overflow, not retryable)
- **THEN** no synthesized `auto_retry_start` SHALL be emitted

#### Scenario: Successful assistant message_end clears retry tracker and synthesizes auto_retry_end
- **GIVEN** the bridge previously synthesized `auto_retry_start` for session X
- **WHEN** the bridge forwards a subsequent `message_end` with `message: { role: "assistant", stopReason: "end_turn" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL forward a synthesized `auto_retry_end { success: true, attempt: <last attempt> }`
- **AND** the retry tracker SHALL clear its in-flight flag for session X

### Requirement: Bridge synthesizes auto_retry_end on user abort

The bridge command handler SHALL synthesize and forward an `auto_retry_end` event with `data: { success: false, attempt: -1, finalError: "Aborted by user" }` immediately after invoking `cachedCtx.abort()` on receipt of an `abort` command. This event SHALL be forwarded via the existing `event_forward` wire shape so the dashboard can clear `retryState` optimistically.

The synthetic event SHALL be idempotent: subsequent synthesized or natural `auto_retry_end`s are no-ops in the reducer when `retryState` is already undefined.

#### Scenario: Abort during retry clears retryState within 200ms
- **GIVEN** a session with `retryState` set
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `{ type: "abort", sessionId }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL invoke `cachedCtx.abort()`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL forward an `event_forward` whose `event.eventType === "auto_retry_end"` and `event.data` matches `{ success: false, attempt: -1, finalError: "Aborted by user" }`

#### Scenario: Abort outside retry phase is harmless
- **GIVEN** a session with `retryState` undefined (e.g. mid-stream, not retrying)
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `abort`
- **THEN** the synthesized `auto_retry_end` SHALL still be forwarded
- **AND** the reducer SHALL ignore it (no-op per the auto_retry_end-without-retryState rule)

### Requirement: Bridge persistent-abort scheduler closes retry race

On receipt of `abort`, after invoking `cachedCtx.abort()` once synchronously, the bridge SHALL schedule additional `cachedCtx.abort()` calls at 200 ms intervals for up to 2 seconds OR until `cachedCtx.isIdle?.()` returns true, whichever comes first. This catches the narrow race window in pi-coding-agent where `_retryAbortController` is briefly `undefined` between sleep-end and the next `agent.continue()` call.

The scheduler SHALL cancel itself if the bridge is unloaded or a new session takes over.

#### Scenario: Persistent abort fires repeatedly until agent is idle
- **GIVEN** the bridge receives `abort` while the agent is mid-retry
- **AND** `cachedCtx.isIdle()` returns false initially
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `cachedCtx.abort()` again at ~200 ms intervals
- **AND** SHALL stop calling once `cachedCtx.isIdle()` returns true OR after 2 s elapsed

#### Scenario: Persistent abort stops immediately when agent becomes idle
- **GIVEN** the bridge has just begun the persistent-abort schedule
- **WHEN** `cachedCtx.isIdle()` returns true on the next interval check
- **THEN** the scheduler SHALL stop without further `abort()` calls

### Requirement: Bridge usage-limit orderer cleans retry-banner → error-banner transition

When the bridge observes an `agent_end` event whose terminal assistant message has `stopReason: "error"` and an `errorMessage` matching `/usage[_ ]limit[_ ]reached|usage_not_included|quota[_ ]exceeded|monthly limit|hourly limit|reset after \d+[hms]/i`, AND the retry tracker reports an in-flight synthesized retry for that session, the bridge SHALL forward a synthesized `auto_retry_end { success: false, attempt: -1, finalError: <errorMessage> }` BEFORE forwarding the `agent_end` event.

This SHALL NOT change pi-coding-agent's retry decisions; it only ensures the dashboard's `retryState` clears before `lastError` is set, avoiding a transient frame where both retry-banner and error-banner are visible.

#### Scenario: Usage-limit terminal error orders synthetic end before agent_end
- **GIVEN** the retry tracker reports an in-flight synthesized retry for session X
- **WHEN** an `agent_end` event arrives whose last message has `stopReason: "error"` and `errorMessage: "usage_limit_reached: 5000 RPM exceeded"`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL forward a synthesized `auto_retry_end` with `success: false` and the error string
- **AND** the bridge SHALL forward the original `agent_end` immediately after

#### Scenario: Non-usage-limit error skips synthesis
- **GIVEN** an `agent_end` arrives with `errorMessage: "tool execution failed"`
- **WHEN** the bridge processes it
- **THEN** no synthesized `auto_retry_end` SHALL be emitted
- **AND** the `agent_end` SHALL be forwarded unchanged
