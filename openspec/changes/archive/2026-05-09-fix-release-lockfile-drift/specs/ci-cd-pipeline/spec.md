## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Release lockfile MUST mirror workspace versions
The release-pipeline `prepare` job in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` SHALL regenerate `package-lock.json` immediately after bumping workspace versions and rewriting cross-ref specifiers, so that the tagged commit contains a lockfile in which every cross-ref specifier matches `^<current-root-version>` exactly. Without this, strict prerelease semver causes `npm ci` on consumers (and the publish job's own CI) to fall back to registry-published tarballs of workspace dependencies, masking the in-tree workspace via nested installs.

#### Scenario: prepare job runs lockfile regen between sync-versions and commit
- **WHEN** the `prepare` job in `publish.yml` runs the `Bump versions and update CHANGELOG` step (or successor)
- **THEN** the job SHALL execute `npm install --package-lock-only --no-audit --no-fund` AFTER `node scripts/sync-versions.js` and BEFORE the `git commit -m "chore(release): ..."` step
- **AND** the regenerated `package-lock.json` SHALL be staged by the existing `git add -A` step and included in the release commit

#### Scenario: prepare job verifies lockfile after regen
- **WHEN** the prepare job has regenerated the lockfile
- **THEN** the job SHALL execute `node scripts/verify-lockfile-versions.mjs` BEFORE the commit step
- **AND** the script SHALL exit non-zero with a file:specifier:expected report if any cross-ref dep specifier in `package-lock.json` does not equal `^<root-version>`

#### Scenario: Repo-lint enforces the step ordering
- **WHEN** the test `publish-workflow-contract.test.ts` runs as part of `npm test`
- **THEN** it SHALL parse `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and assert the `prepare` job's step list contains the lockfile-regen step in the position `sync-versions < regen < git commit`
- **AND** failure SHALL cite change `fix-release-lockfile-drift` in the assertion message

#### Scenario: Local release-cut path documents the lockfile step
- **WHEN** a maintainer cuts a release manually (not via `workflow_dispatch`)
- **THEN** the `release-cut` skill in `.pi/skills/release-cut/SKILL.md` SHALL document running `npm install --package-lock-only` between `sync-versions.js` and the commit step
- **AND** `scripts/sync-versions.js` SHALL print a console hint pointing the maintainer at the right command
