## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Server selector in dashboard header
The dashboard header SHALL include a server selector dropdown showing known servers (persisted) plus, **only when the page is served from a loopback origin**, a `localhost` "Local" entry. The `localhost` "Local" row SHALL be seeded ONLY when `window.location.hostname` is one of `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`. When the dashboard is served from a remote host, the selector SHALL NOT seed a `localhost` entry — the current (served) origin is the operative server — so the selector never shows a phantom "localhost:<port> is unreachable" row that probes the browser's own machine.

Availability probing SHALL run once per dropdown open — not on mount, not on a timer, not while the dropdown is closed. Entries whose probes report unreachable SHALL be rendered with reduced opacity, a `disabled` attribute, and a `cursor-not-allowed` affordance; the selector SHALL NOT call `onSwitch` for unreachable entries. A probe that fails the network guard (HTTP 403 `network_not_allowed`) SHALL be rendered as a distinct "Network not allowed" state — NOT "Unreachable" — since the server is reachable but the client's network/auth is not permitted.

#### Scenario: Loopback origin seeds localhost
- **WHEN** the page origin hostname is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- **THEN** the selector SHALL seed the `localhost` "Local" entry first, then known servers

#### Scenario: Remote origin does NOT seed localhost
- **WHEN** the page is served from a non-loopback host (e.g. `pennyroyal.lan`)
- **THEN** the selector SHALL NOT seed a `localhost` entry
- **AND** no "localhost:<port> is unreachable" row SHALL appear
- **AND** the served origin SHALL be the operative current entry

#### Scenario: 403 renders as Network not allowed, not Unreachable
- **WHEN** an entry's probe (or a guarded API call to it) returns HTTP 403 with `error: "network_not_allowed"`
- **THEN** that entry SHALL render a "Network not allowed" indicator distinct from the "Unreachable" indicator
- **AND** a transport failure or non-403 probe failure SHALL still render "Unreachable"
