## 1. Facts (gathered — recorded, do not re-derive)

- [x] 1.1 Root cause proven: `truncateStrings` exempts `data`+`mimeType` (line 224);
      `exceedsSerializedSize` trips the 20 KB ceiling → `{__truncated}` → no
      `data.message` → no row, silently.
- [x] 1.2 Measured end-to-end at production defaults: 8/8 over-ceiling assistant messages
      survive; 3/3 image-bearing user messages collapse.
- [x] 1.3 Size distribution (n=1587, 3137 transcripts): p50 125.7 KB, p90 757.3 KB,
      p99 2233.3 KB, max 10.5 MB. Raw ceiling coverage at 256 KB is only 74.9 %.
- [x] 1.4 Resize (n=40, jimp 768 px/q75): p50 42 KB, p90 101 KB, **max 212 KB** — the
      tail becomes bounded, which is what makes a 256 KB ceiling deterministic.
- [x] 1.5 Resize cost: 174–874 ms single-threaded → must be offloaded.
- [x] 1.6 Only `type:"image"` carries `data`+`mimeType` in real data.
- [x] 1.7 `pi-image-fit` is installed but unusable here (ephemeral caches, pi-session
      process, model-input policy) — use jimp directly.

## 2. Resolve remaining design decisions

- [x] 2.1 D9 — **accept** the `0.75 ×` coupling and the 15 KB → 192 KB terminal-cap shift;
      document it. Derivation stays coupled; the boot assert keeps validating the pair.
- [x] 2.2 D10 — **REVERSED.** No disk cache ships. Fitted derivatives ride their own
      `attachment_fitted` event and are addressed by content hash; the session transcript
      is the only durable record, so there is nothing to evict, cap, or invalidate and no
      second source of truth to keep coherent.
      Original: D10 — **cache** fitted derivatives on disk keyed by content hash; a miss
      re-fits. Optimisation only, never a source of truth.
- [x] 2.3 D11 — **exempt** animated GIFs from fitting; they stay subject to the existing
      ceiling and truncate as today. Never emit a corrupt frame (X10).

## 3. Tests — L1 unit (vitest)

All L1 rows extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/memory-event-store.test.ts`
(harness exemplar: that file's `createMemoryEventStore(neverPinned)` fixtures).

- [x] 3.1 E1/E2/E3 fitting bounds the event (test-plan #E1 #E2 #E3) — input 10.5 MB / 2.2 MB /
      126 KB image · trigger ingest · observable stored event ≤ 256 KB with `data.message`.
      **Must fail before implementation.**
- [x] 3.2 E4/E5/E6 no-upscale + fit boundary (test-plan #E4 #E5 #E6) — input 0.2 KB, 767 px,
      769 px · trigger ingest · observable unchanged / unchanged / long edge 768 px.
- [x] 3.3 E7 message survives (test-plan #E7) — input text + 10.5 MB image · trigger
      ingest · observable event is not `{__truncated}`, `data.message.role === "user"`.
- [x] 3.4 E8 many attachments (test-plan #E8) — input 20 × 2 MB blocks · trigger ingest ·
      observable event ≤ 256 KB, all blocks fitted.
- [x] 3.5 E9 replay is fitted (test-plan #E9) — input JSONL with inline 5 MB image ·
      trigger replay · observable emitted event ≤ 256 KB.
- [x] 3.6 E10 fitted max fits ceiling (test-plan #E10) — input 212 KB fitted image ·
      trigger ingest · observable under ceiling, no truncation.
- [x] 3.7 E11/E12/E13 boot assert armed (test-plan #E11 #E12 #E13) — input cap unset + 256 KB /
      cap unset + 20 KB / cap 50_000 + 256 KB · trigger boot · observable passes / throws
      / throws. E12 is the negative proof the assert no longer skips.
      Landed in `terminal-manager.test.ts` (home of `deriveTranscriptCapBytes`), not
      `memory-event-store.test.ts` — the assert is that module's export.
- [x] 3.8 E14/E15 content-type allow-list (test-plan #E14 #E15) — input jpeg/png/gif/webp
      and a blob claiming `text/html` · trigger serve · observable allow-listed type,
      never active content.
- [x] 3.9 X1/X2 authorisation (test-plan #X1 #X2) — input unauthorised caller and a
      wrong-session caller with a valid hash · trigger GET original · observable refused.
- [x] 3.10 X3 path safety (test-plan #X3) — input id with `../` or non-hex · trigger GET ·
      observable rejected, no fs access outside the store root.
- [x] 3.11 X6 recovery covered (clean 404, transcript-backed); X4/X5 DROPPED with the
      caches (D10 reversed) — they only tested cache eviction/cap.
      Original: 3.11 X4/X5/X6 recovery + eviction (test-plan #X4 #X5 #X6) — input evicted blob with
      transcript intact / at 2 GB cap / transcript deleted · trigger GET · observable
      recovered / still retrievable / clean 404 without crash.
- [x] 3.12 X7/X8/X9 worker faults (test-plan #X7 #X8 #X9) — input worker crash / saturated pool
      / undecodable bytes · trigger ingest · observable message stored with `data.message`,
      attachment resolves to failed state, event loop not blocked.
- [x] 3.13 X10 animated GIF (test-plan #X10) — input animated GIF over bound · trigger
      ingest · observable preserved INTACT, never fitted and never a corrupt frame (D11
      exempts animation from fitting). Ingest declines it too, so it is left inline and
      never promised a placeholder — the two-phase gates must admit the same set. Over
      the ceiling it truncates as it always has (see #424).
- [x] 3.14 P1/P2 event-loop lag (test-plan #P1 #P2) — workload one 10 MB image, then
      5 × 2 MB · metric max event-loop lag < 50 ms · uses the lag helper (§6.1). P1
      passing. P2 RESOLVED in 9.5: the apparent "worker ~1030 ms" was the burst's WALL
      TIME under the vitest runner, not loop blocking; measured cleanly outside the
      runner both paths block ~0 ms and the pool is ~1.7x faster. D4 stands, restated as
      throughput + CPU isolation. P2 stays skipped as a record of the pitfall.
- [x] 3.15 P3 broadcast payload (test-plan #P3) — workload fitted image-bearing message ·
      metric frame < 256 KB, ≪ 4 MB `MAX_WS_BUFFER`.
- [x] 3.16 P4 recovery memory (test-plan #P4) — workload original lookup against a 50 MB
      transcript · metric peak RSS delta < 50 MB, proving the scan streams rather than
      slurps. ("cache miss" in the original wording died with D10; every lookup is a
      transcript scan now.)

## 4. Tests — L3 Playwright e2e

All L3 rows go in `tests/e2e/`; harness exemplar
`tests/e2e/chat-transcript-virtualization.spec.ts` (row-measure + virtualized transcript
glue) and `tests/e2e/chat-render-fx.spec.ts` (chat render assertions). Read the harness
port from `.pi-test-harness.json` (`dashboardPort`) — never hardcode `:18000`.

- [x] 4.1 F1/F2 two-phase render (test-plan #F1 #F2) — input message + 5 MB attachment ·
      trigger send, then fitting completes · observable row present before any image,
      placeholder in the attachment position, converging to `<img>` in the same position
      with row count unchanged.
- [x] 4.2 F3 fitting failure is honest (test-plan #F3) — input corrupt image bytes ·
      trigger fitting fails · observable explicit failed state, row still present, no
      indefinite pending.
- [x] 4.3 F4 reload mid-fit (test-plan #F4) — input 10.5 MB attachment · trigger reload
      before fitting completes · observable row renders; attachment resolves or shows
      failed state.
- [x] 4.4 F5/F6 original view (test-plan #F5 #F6) — input rendered fitted image; then a
      404 from the original endpoint · trigger user opens it · observable full-resolution
      original byte-identical to input; on failure the fitted image still renders and only
      zoom degrades.
- [x] 4.5 F7 replay renders images (test-plan #F7) — input session with image messages ·
      trigger reload · observable every image-bearing row renders an image.
- [x] 4.6 F8 row-height stability (test-plan #F8) — input virtualized transcript with
      image rows · trigger scroll out and back · observable stable height, no collapse or
      overlap. Guards the existing `chat-view` invariant.
- [x] 4.7 P5 image-heavy replay (test-plan #P5) — passing after the 9.4 fix. Workload 20 image-bearing messages ·
      trigger replay · observable completes with no gateway frame dropped.

## 5. Implement

- [x] 5.1 Display-fit worker (jimp, 768 px/q75) invoked off the event loop.
- [x] 5.2 Ingest seam: fit image blocks, store the derivative inline.
- [x] 5.3 Two-phase emission: row first, attachment resolves later (D3).
- [x] 5.4 Raise `DEFAULT_MAX_EVENT_DATA_SIZE` to 256 KiB (`262_144`, per test-plan #E13).
- [x] 5.5 Export `DEFAULT_MAX_STRING_SIZE`; `deriveTranscriptCapBytes` defaults an
      UNSET cap to it (explicit `0` still means disabled); `server.ts` passes
      `config.maxStringFieldSize` through instead of `?? 0` — landed atomically with 5.4.
- [x] 5.6 D9: terminal cap derivation stays coupled; 15 KB → 192 KiB shift documented on
      `DEFAULT_MAX_EVENT_DATA_SIZE` + `deriveTranscriptCapBytes` and asserted in E15.
- [x] 5.7 Session-scoped originals endpoint + transcript-backed streaming resolver.
- [~] 5.8 DROPPED as speculative (D10 reversed): originals stream from the transcript
      (<50 MB RSS for ~40 MB, P4) and the zoom path is not load-bearing.
- [~] 5.10 DROPPED as speculative (D10 reversed): warm replay never re-fits, and the
      two-phase render already hides cold-open fit latency.
- [x] 5.11 D11: animated-GIF detection → bypass fitting, keep existing ceiling handling.
- [x] 5.9a Client: reducer `attachment_fitted` case + placeholder/failed rendering
      (`ChatImage.attachmentId`/`attachmentState`, `ChatView` pending + failed states).
- [x] 5.9b Client: click-to-original overlay — zoom opens the full-resolution
      original, falling back to the inline fitted derivative on failure (F6).

## 6. New infra

- [x] 6.1 Event-loop-lag helper for L1 (no existing test measures it) — needed by 3.14.
- [x] 6.2 Attachment-endpoint fixtures: a session with a known hash plus an unauthorised
      caller — needed by 3.9–3.11.

## 7. Verify

- [x] 7.1 `npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pi-test.log` then `grep -nE 'FAIL|Error|✗' /tmp/pi-test.log`.
- [x] 7.2 `npm run build` + `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/restart`.
- [x] 7.3 Acceptance PASSED — the original report. Verified in a real browser against an
      ISOLATED dashboard (temp HOME on :8123) running worktree code, seeded with the real
      `019fca04` transcript; live :8000 untouched (pid unchanged, no build leak — main
      `packages/client/dist` never written). Result: row renders, `"The layout is not ok"`
      visible, screenshot renders at natural size **768x214** (fitted to the display bound),
      `complete:true`, 0 pending / 0 failed. Server side: 1 placeholder + 1
      `attachment_fitted` on the hydration path.
- [x] 7.4 DEFERRED post-merge (manual, live-environment only) — paste a fresh ~2 MB screenshot on the LIVE dashboard. NOT done here: an isolated
      server has no pi bridge to send a prompt through, and driving the live dashboard was
      out of scope. Substance is covered by browser E2E on the docker harness — F1/F2 (row
      first, then fitted image), F7 (survives reload), F5 (click opens the full-resolution
      original) — so this remains only a live-environment sanity check.
- [x] 7.5 Docs (Documentation Update Protocol): 20/20 changed source files carry a row in
      their NEAREST directory `AGENTS.md` (attachments/, routes/, test-support/, chat/,
      persistence/, terminal/, tests/e2e/, docker/); `docs/architecture.md` gained a
      two-phase-attachment section (protocol + data-flow change) via DocScribe, and its
      `docs/AGENTS.md` row was amended.

## 8. Manual (deferred post-merge — test-plan disposition: manual-only)

- [x] 8.1 DEFERRED post-merge (test-plan #F9, manual-only) — F9 legibility — view a UI screenshot fitted at
      768 px/q75 and judge whether text is legible enough that click-to-original is an
      enhancement rather than a necessity. Directly tests the main risk of the 768 px
      choice; if it fails, revisit the display size.

## 9. Follow-up filings

- [x] 9.1 FILED #415 — Mid-turn `bridgeFollowUp` image loss (`bridge.ts:355` is `string[]`; images
      dropped on drain while streaming) — a genuine *delivery* bug, separate from this.
- [x] 9.3 FILED #417 — Extract a generic `worker_threads` pool — `fit-worker-pool.ts` is the THIRD
      copy (`openspec-poll`, `session-load`, `fit`), which is the rule-of-three trigger
      the existing pools' headers explicitly defer to.
- [x] 9.4 FIXED: identical images share one content hash, so a single
      `attachment_fitted` resolves several rows. The reducer stopped at the FIRST
      match, stranding every later copy on "loading". Now patches every occurrence
      (idempotent). Root-caused by comparing pending vs fitted ids on the wire:
      8 attachments but only 1 distinct id.
- [x] 9.5 D4 re-evaluated and RESOLVED: offload KEPT, rationale corrected. Clean
      measurement (outside vitest, 3 runs) shows in-process lag is ~0 ms (jimp v1 yields),
      so the original "inline resize stalls the loop" premise was wrong — but the pool is
      ~1.7x faster on a burst and transfer costs only ~6 ms. design.md D4 rewritten with
      the numbers. The earlier "worker lag ~1030 ms" reading was wall time leaking into
      the sample inside the test runner.
- [x] 9.6 FILED #418 — Revisit caching ONLY if cold-open latency for image-heavy sessions is measured
      as a real problem (D10 reversed on evidence; see design.md).
- [x] 9.2 FILED #416 — Retire inline-attachment truncation paths that the two-phase flow
      makes unreachable FOR FITTABLE STATIC IMAGES (`capContentBlocks` slicing, the
      line-224 exemption, `isImageBlock`'s depth-limit use). Scoped deliberately: those
      paths are still LIVE for blocks outside the two-phase boundary — animated GIFs
      (exempt from fitting, D11) and non-fittable MIME keep full-resolution bytes inline,
      so "no full-resolution base64 reaches the store" is NOT true in general. Retiring
      them wholesale would drop the only bound those blocks have (see #424).
