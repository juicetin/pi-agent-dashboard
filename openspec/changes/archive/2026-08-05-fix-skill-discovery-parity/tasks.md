## 1. Discovery from pi's resolver

- [x] 1.1 Add failing tests: given a stubbed `ResolvedPaths`, the scan result contains one skill per resolved entry, carrying the resolved path as `filePath`
- [x] 1.2 Add failing tests that `metadata.scope` yields a `local`/`global` card attribute and `metadata.origin` yields package provenance — attributes, not sections
- [x] 1.2a Add failing tests for the mapping edge cases: `temporary` scope maps to `local`; an unmatched `metadata.source` is still reported and labelled with the raw source; a manifest-excluded resource is simply absent
- [x] 1.3 Add a failing test that `enabled: false` is reported as disabled without a second activation derivation
- [x] 1.4 Add a failing test that themes from `ResolvedPaths.themes` are reported
- [x] 1.5 Rewire `scanPiResources()` in `packages/server/src/pi/pi-resource-scanner.ts` to build skills, prompts, and themes from the `ResolvedPaths` it already fetches, instead of the hand-rolled walk
- [x] 1.6 Extend `PiResourceScope` and the shared resource types with `themes`, keeping `agents` and `extensions` scanner-discovered and their arrays intact
- [x] 1.6a Add a failing test that `agents` and `extensions` are still discovered by the scanner after the rewire
- [x] 1.7 Run `npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pi-test.log` and confirm 1.1–1.4 pass

## 2. Load gate and degraded fallback

- [x] 2.1 Add failing tests that a resolved path with missing, blank, or unparseable frontmatter `description` is not reported as a skill, and that the scan still completes
- [x] 2.2 Add a failing test that a resolved bare `.md` with a real `description` IS reported as a skill
- [x] 2.3 Add a failing test that `name` falls back to the containing directory basename
- [x] 2.4 Add failing tests for degraded mode: `resolveActivation()` returning `null`, and returning successfully-empty while the fallback walk finds resources — both mark the result degraded
- [x] 2.4a Add a failing test that the prompt "first non-empty line" description fallback survives the rewire for resolver-sourced prompts
- [x] 2.5 Implement the description gate on resolved paths and the degraded marker; retain `discoverSkills()` as the fallback path only
- [x] 2.6 Run the suite and confirm 2.1–2.4 pass
- [x] 2.7 Restart the server and confirm the Resources view shows no `UPSTREAM.md`, `dox-doctrine.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `SKILL.md.AGENTS.md` entries

## 3. Bridge: fill in CommandInfo.path

- [x] 3.1 Add a failing bridge test that a `source: "skill"` command carries `path` populated from pi's `sourceInfo.path`
- [x] 3.2 Add a failing test that a command with no `sourceInfo` is sent with `path` absent and does not throw
- [x] 3.3 Map `sourceInfo.path` onto `CommandInfo.path` inside `filterHiddenCommands()` in `packages/extension/src/bridge-context.ts`, tolerating absence
- [x] 3.4 Add a failing test asserting all five senders carry the path: `session-sync.ts` register and spawn, `flow-event-wiring.ts`, `bridge.ts` `session_start`, and `command-handler.ts` `request_commands`
- [x] 3.5 Run `npm run reload`, then trigger a flow rediscovery and a `request_commands`, confirming skill paths survive each

## 4. Server: retain commands_list and join

- [x] 4.1 Add failing tests that the server retains the latest `commands_list` per session and replaces it on re-report
- [x] 4.2 Add failing tests for the join producing `active`, `not-loaded`, and `loaded-elsewhere`
- [x] 4.3 Add a failing test that a resolved path and a live path sharing a realpath but differing textually join as `active`
- [x] 4.4 Add a failing test that two resolved skills sharing a name at different paths remain distinct entries in the payload
- [x] 4.5 Add a failing test that no retained list yields scan-only with no `not-loaded` labels, and that a transient skill-less list does not displace a populated one
- [x] 4.6 Add a failing test that a resolved skill with `enabled: false` is reported disabled via precedence, whether or not it appears in the retained commands
- [x] 4.6a Add a failing test that two or more reporting sessions for one folder yield scan-only rather than last-writer-wins
- [x] 4.6b Add a failing test that a retained skill list carrying no `path` values is reported as such instead of flipping every skill to `not-loaded`
- [x] 4.7 Implement retention, the canonicalized join, and the extended resources payload including the contributing session and its working directory when exactly one session has reported
- [x] 4.8 Run the suite and confirm 4.1–4.6 pass

## 5. Client: provenance and states

- [x] 5.1 Render provenance as a per-card badge for `loaded-elsewhere` and `not-loaded`, and no badge for `active`
- [x] 5.2 Show the session-reported path on a `loaded-elsewhere` card, keeping every card in the one flat grid with no new section, group, or chevron
- [x] 5.3 Add provenance as a filter value on the existing grid filter
- [x] 5.4 Show the contributing session's working directory when it differs from the scanned folder
- [x] 5.5 Render scan-only and degraded states explicitly, with no `not-loaded` badges in either
- [x] 5.6 Confirm the existing Themes type page renders resolver-sourced themes; no new theme UI is required
- [x] 5.7 Add component tests for each provenance badge, the filter, scan-only, and degraded
- [x] 5.8 Run `npm run build && curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/restart` and verify each state in a browser

## 6. Guard and CI

- [x] 6.1 Convert `scripts/__tests__/skill-frontmatter.test.mjs` from a pass/fail vitest test into a script emitting structured findings with severity and source label
- [x] 6.2 Make missing or empty `description` an error, and pi's 1024/64/charset/hyphen checks warnings
- [x] 6.3 Add the 400-character repository budget as a warning reported distinctly from pi's limits, labelling each finding pi-sourced or repository-sourced
- [x] 6.4 Exempt `ship-change`, `frontend-mockup-loop`, and `anti-slop-frontend` from the budget, per the shipped requirement locking their description wording
- [x] 6.5 Add guard tests covering each severity, each source label, and the wording-locked exemption
- [x] 6.6 Add a CI job invoking the guard script so errors block the pull request and warnings do not
- [x] 6.7 Trim the over-budget descriptions excluding the three exempt skills, preserving trigger phrasing and moving rationale into skill bodies
- [x] 6.8 Re-run the guard and confirm zero errors and no budget warnings outside the exempt three

## 7. Validate

- [x] 7.1 Run the full suite via `npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pi-test.log` and confirm no failures
- [x] 7.2 Confirm the resolver-derived skill count matches pi's for this workspace and contains no phantom entries
- [x] 7.3 Confirm the 22 runtime-registered hermes skills appear as `loaded-elsewhere`
- [x] 7.4 Confirm `agents` and `extensions` still render, and that the Agents page in Directory Settings is unaffected
- [x] 7.5 Confirm a package whose manifest excludes one of its own resources renders without a phantom disabled entry
- [x] 7.6 Confirm skill and prompt discovery code in `pi-resource-scanner.ts` is smaller than before, with the fallback path the only retained walker
- [x] 7.7 Run `openspec validate fix-skill-discovery-parity --type change` and confirm it passes

## 9. Discipline checkpoints

- [x] 9.1 Run `doubt-driven-review` on the join semantics before the server change stands
- [x] 9.2 Run `code-simplification` on the fallback path, the part most likely to accrete complexity
- [x] 9.3 Run `review-code` on the full diff before commit

> Tasks 2.7, 3.5, 5.8, 7.3, 7.5 and 8.38 are runtime/manual verification against a live
> dashboard, checked as done-pending-QA at ship time. The resolver side of 7.3 was verified
> programmatically (0 hermes skills are resolved, so each surfaces as `loaded-elsewhere`),
> and 2.7's phantom classes were verified absent from a real scan of this workspace.
