## Context

Issue #357: `pi install git:github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-agent-dashboard` fails at two
independent points on a fresh machine, both still present in released `0.6.1`.

- pi installs extensions via `npm install --omit=dev` with engine-strict.
- Root `package.json#engines.node` caps `>=22.19.0 <26`; the single-source predicate
  `packages/shared/src/node-version.ts::isOutOfEnginesRange` mirrors it (`major >= 26`). The server
  startup guard (`packages/server/src/auth/node-guard.ts`), the Electron doctor
  (`dependency-detector.ts`), and their tests all track that predicate via a documented lockstep
  contract. Caveat: the guard's `buildEnginesRangeMessage` hardcodes the range string
  `Required: >=22.19.0 <26`, which the lockstep does NOT cover — it must be edited by hand.
- The published npm tarball ships prebuilt `packages/dist/client` and does NOT run any workspace
  `prepare` on consumer install, so the npm path is unaffected by the build blocker. The git-clone
  path clones source (dist is gitignored), runs every workspace `prepare`, and the
  `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-web` `prepare` runs a Vite build.

Current build-time resolution of the client:
- `packages/client/scripts/vite-build.mjs` `import { register } from "tsx/esm/api"` then
  `require.resolve("vite/package.json")`.
- `packages/client/vite.config.ts` imports `@vitejs/plugin-react` and `@tailwindcss/vite`;
  `src/index.css` does `@import "tailwindcss"`.
- `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `tailwindcss` are client `devDependencies`.
- `tsx` is NOT a client dep; it currently resolves only because `packages/server` declares `tsx` as a
  runtime `dependency` and npm hoists it to the root `node_modules`.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- `pi install git:...` succeeds on Node 26 without `--engine-strict=false`.
- `npm install --omit=dev` on a fresh checkout completes the client `prepare` Vite build with no
  manual dev-dependency install.
- Node 26 is CI-validated, not merely asserted.
- The Node-version single-source + lockstep contract is preserved (only `node-version.ts` +
  `package.json#engines` encode the cap).

**Non-Goals:**
- Node 27+ support (left refused until separately validated).
- Shipping prebuilt client assets into git, a server-side lazy build, or removing the client
  `prepare` build.
- Changing the `packages/server` or root `tsx` dependency roles.

## Decisions

### D1 — Raise the engines cap one major (`<26` → `<27`), not remove the upper bound

Bumping to `<27` keeps the "cap = highest CI-validated major + refuse beyond" invariant the codebase
already relies on. Removing the bound entirely would silently admit every future major untested,
defeating the server startup guard's purpose. The cap changes in **three** places:
`package.json#engines.node`, `node-version.ts::isOutOfEnginesRange` (`major >= 26 → >= 27`), and the
hardcoded `Required: >=22.19.0 <26` string in `buildEnginesRangeMessage`
(`packages/server/src/auth/node-guard.ts`). The first two are the documented single-source contract;
the third is a **hole in that contract** — a literal the lockstep never covered, which this change
both fixes (task 2.4) and guards with a new repo-lint (task 2.5) so the next cap raise cannot miss
it. Every other consumer + test tracks the cap through the predicate.

_Alternative considered:_ open-ended `>=22.19.0`. Rejected — turns the refuse-to-start guard into a
no-op for future majors and contradicts the spec's cap-history rationale.

### D2 — Validate Node 26 in CI before the cap lands

Add a Node 26 leg to the `_smoke.yml` `standalone-install-smoke-linux` install matrix — the sole
Node-major matrix the `server-startup-node-version-guard` spec enforces (`ci.yml` has none). The
Node 26 legs run **without** the `--config.engine-strict=false` override every other leg carries, so
the `EBADENGINE` half of #357 is regression-tested rather than assumed: with the override in place,
CI cannot distinguish "cap fixed" from "still refused". The override is safe to drop on Linux —
`_smoke.yml`'s stated rationale (the transitive `appdmg` engine range) does not hold: `appdmg@0.6.6`
declares `engines: >=8.5` with `os: [darwin]`, so it carries no upper bound and is platform-filtered
out of Linux installs; the real historical cause per `.npmrc` was native compilation of
`macos-alias`. The lockfile's only upper-bounded engines range (`>=6 <7 || >=8`) admits 26. The cap
raise is contingent on that leg passing —
if Node 26 surfaces a real incompatibility (Fastify, native deps), the change is blocked rather than
shipping a broken cap. `isAffectedNode` needs no change (Node 26 is outside the Fastify-affected
range).

### D3 — Declare the client's direct build deps as runtime `dependencies`

Move `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `tailwindcss` from client `devDependencies`
→ `dependencies`, and add `tsx` to client `dependencies`. Rationale: `--omit=dev` omits
`devDependencies`; the direct build-time requirements must therefore be runtime deps of the package
that runs the build. `tsx` is declared explicitly on the client (the package whose
`vite-build.mjs` imports it) instead of relying on the fragile hoist of the `packages/server` `tsx`
dep — hoisting can break on a version conflict and is an undeclared cross-workspace coupling.

_Alternative considered:_ (a) ship prebuilt assets in git — rejected (build artifacts in VCS). (b)
server-side lazy build — rejected (larger surface, needs build deps at runtime anyway). (c) guard
`prepare` to no-op + document a manual full install — rejected (leaves the reported command broken;
the issue asks for it to "just work").

### D4 — Lockstep guard so the deps don't silently regress

Add `scripts/verify-release-deps.mjs` rules asserting the 5 client build deps live in
`dependencies` (mirrors the existing `tsx`/`openspec` rules). A future refactor moving any back to
`devDependencies` would silently re-break git-install; the guard fails the release instead.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **[Consumer install bloat]** → `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-web` now pulls `vite` +
  tailwind + tsx as runtime deps. Mitigation: the published root-package global install ships
  prebuilt `dist/` and never runs `prepare`, so the end-user CLI install is unchanged in behavior;
  the extra weight lands only when the web workspace itself is installed (the git path, which needs
  them anyway). Accepted per planning decision.
- **[Node 26 real incompatibility]** → surfaced by the CI smoke leg (D2); blocks the cap raise rather
  than shipping broken. Rollback = revert the two cap lines.
- **[Hoist behavior masking the fix]** → because `tsx` already hoists from server today, an
  `--omit=dev` build might appear to pass without the client `tsx` dep. Mitigation: the L2 test runs a
  clean `npm install --omit=dev` from a pristine checkout and asserts `packages/client/dist/index.html`
  exists; the `verify-release-deps` rule (D4) independently asserts the explicit declaration.

## Migration Plan

1. Land the client `package.json` deps move + `tsx` add; refresh `pnpm-lock.yaml` via `pnpm install`.
2. Add the Node 26 CI smoke leg; confirm green.
3. Raise the cap (`package.json#engines.node` + `node-version.ts` + the `buildEnginesRangeMessage`
   range string in `packages/server/src/auth/node-guard.ts`), and correct the pre-existing
   node-version + node-guard assertions that encode the old `<26` cap.
4. Add the `verify-release-deps` rules.

Rollback: revert the two cap lines (Node 26 support) and/or restore the client deps to
`devDependencies` (git-install build) — independent, either can roll back alone.

## Open Questions

None — direction confirmed with the maintainer (both blockers in one change; cap → `<27` after CI
validation; move build deps to `dependencies`).
