# Test Plan — unify-folder-status-capsule

Stage: design   Generated: 2026-08-14

Clarification gate: **passed**. Three unfillable slots were resolved before this
catalog was written and folded back into the spec as requirements — count cap
(`999+`), counting budget (1000 sessions / 5 ms), and the filtered-target
observable (the reveal path's existing filtered notice). No `[NEEDS
CLARIFICATION]` markers remain.

## Scenarios

### Edge-case

| id | requirement | technique | level | disposition | input | trigger | expected observable |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| E1 | Segments are severity-ordered | decision-table | L1 | automated | folder with 1 needs-you, 9 error, 1 working, 1 idle | capsule counts + renders | segments emit in order needs-you, error, working, idle — magnitude does not reorder |
| E2 | Segments are severity-ordered | state-transition | L1 | automated | folder with only error + idle | capsule renders | error precedes idle; no empty slots between them |
| E3 | Empty segments do not render | EP | L1 | automated | folder with 12 idle, 0 of every other state | capsule renders | exactly one segment renders, the idle one |
| E4 | Empty segments do not render | BVA (zero boundary) | L1 | automated | folder with 0 sessions | header renders | no `folder-status-capsule-<cwd>` element in the DOM |
| E5 | Empty segments do not render | BVA (all-excluded boundary) | L1 | automated | folder whose 5 sessions all have status `ended` | header renders | no capsule element; the folder's `N ended` disclosure row still reports 5 |
| E6 | Ended/hidden/widget-bar excluded before bucketing | decision-table | L1 | automated | one session `status: ended` with its notice flag still set | counting pass runs | session appears in no bucket (guards the `hasNotice`-before-status short-circuit) |
| E7 | Ended/hidden/widget-bar excluded before bucketing | EP | L1 | automated | folder of 3 visible + 4 `hidden` sessions, mixed states | counting pass runs | only the 3 visible sessions are counted |
| E8 | Needs-you counted by explicit predicate | decision-table | L1 | automated | `ask_user` session whose widget-bar classification is `undefined` | counting pass runs | counted in **no** bucket — not needs-you, not idle (guards the `hasWidgetBarPrompt = false` coercion) |
| E9 | Needs-you counted by explicit predicate | decision-table | L1 | automated | `ask_user` session classified `true` (widget-bar-placed) | counting pass runs | counted in no bucket; specifically **absent** from idle |
| E10 | Needs-you counted by explicit predicate | decision-table | L1 | automated | `ask_user` session that is ALSO in `errorSessionIds` | counting pass runs | counted exactly once, in error; needs-you count is 0 |
| E11 | A retrying session counts as working | EP | L1 | automated | one session in `retrySessionIds`, no other live sessions | counting pass runs | working = 1, error = 0 |
| E12 | A noticed session counts as idle | EP | L1 | automated | one idle session in `noticeSessionIds` | counting pass runs | idle = 1 — the session is not dropped (guards the unbucketed `notice` shape) |
| E13 | Segment counts capped at four glyphs | BVA (just below) | L1 | automated | segment count 999 | capsule renders | segment text is exactly `999` |
| E14 | Segment counts capped at four glyphs | BVA (just above) | L1 | automated | segment count 1000 | capsule renders | segment text is exactly `999+` |
| E15 | Capsule is the only liveness surface | decision-table | L1 | automated | any folder with sessions | header renders | no raw `(N)` count, no needs-you pill, no status rollup element present |

### Performance

| id | requirement | technique | level | disposition | workload | metric + threshold | window |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|----------|--------------------|--------|
| P1 | Counting is linear in session count | threshold (timed unit) | L1 | automated | one folder of 1000 sessions spanning every status, half `ask_user` with a populated widget-bar map | wall time of the counting pass < 5 ms | single call, median of 5 runs |

### Frontend-quirk

| id | requirement | technique | level | disposition | input | trigger | expected observable (invariant) |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|---------|---------------------------------|
| F1 | Capsule renders in both collapse states | state-transition | L3 | automated | folder with mixed live states, initially collapsed | user expands the folder | capsule remains present with identical segment counts across the transition |
| F2 | Non-idle segments are navigation targets | state-transition | L3 | automated | collapsed folder with ≥1 errored session | user activates the error segment | folder converges to expanded AND the first errored session becomes the selected session |
| F3 | Activation does not toggle the row | state-transition (illegal edge) | L3 | automated | expanded folder, header row has its own click handler | user activates any segment | folder stays expanded — the row handler does not fire (guards missing `stopPropagation`) |
| F4 | Scroll sequenced after expansion commits | state-convergence | L3 | automated | collapsed folder whose target card mounts only when expanded | user activates a segment | target card converges to scrolled-into-view — not a silent no-op against an unmounted body |
| F5 | Idle segment is inert but labelled | state-transition (illegal edge) | L1 | automated | capsule rendering an idle count | keyboard tabs through the header | idle segment never receives focus, and exposes an accessible name naming the state |
| F6 | Segments carry distinct accessible labels | decision-table | L1 | automated | capsule with all four segments | accessibility tree read | each non-idle segment has a distinct name stating both its count and its state |
| F7 | Capsule never wraps; name absorbs the squeeze | BVA (width boundary) | L3 | automated | folder with a long name and all four segments present (one session each) | sidebar narrowed to 220 px | capsule stays on one row with every segment present; the folder-name region truncates |
| F8 | Capsule uses the status token family | decision-table | L1 | automated | capsule with a working segment; a working session card in the same folder | both render | both reference the same `--status-working` custom property (token identity, not pixel equality) |
| F9 | Unclassified probe does not flash a high count | state-convergence | L3 | automated | folder mounting with 3 `ask_user` sessions whose probes resolve on a later tick | folder first paints | needs-you count never exceeds its settled value at any observed frame — it converges upward, never downward |
| F10 | Capsule visual density beside the menu trigger | visual/subjective | — | manual-only | a real sidebar with several folders in mixed states | human looks at the sidebar | [judgment: the capsule reads as one control and the purple needs-you signal still pre-attentively dominates — no automatable observable] |

> **F7 workload relaxed during implementation.** As first drafted the workload read "all four segments at 3-glyph counts", which needs 400+ real sessions in one folder — not seedable against the docker harness, where sessions are spawned as real `pi` processes. The workload is now one session per segment. The invariant under test is unchanged (capsule stays on one row, name absorbs the squeeze) and still requires real geometry, so the row stays L3/automated rather than dropping to jsdom, which has no layout. The non-shrink/non-wrap *mechanism* (`flex-none` + `whitespace-nowrap`) is additionally pinned at L1 in `FolderStatusCapsule.test.tsx`. Segment density under high counts is covered by the human check F10.

### Error-handling

| id | requirement | technique | level | disposition | fault | trigger | expected observable |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| X1 | Filtered-out target degrades, not no-ops | fault-injection (target unreachable) | L3 | automated | an active session-search filter excludes the segment's target session | user activates that segment | the reveal path's existing filtered-target notice is surfaced; the app does not silently do nothing |
| X2 | Hidden target degrades | fault-injection (target unreachable) | L3 | automated | `showHidden` off while the only session of a counted state is hidden | user activates that segment | either the state is not counted (per E7) or the reveal path's hidden-target notice is surfaced — never a silent no-op |
| X3 | Counting survives a malformed flag set | fault-injection (bad input) | L1 | automated | `errorSessionIds` / `noticeSessionIds` passed as `undefined` | counting pass runs | pass completes and buckets on the remaining signals; no throw |

No L2 rows: this change is client-only, with no process, install, spawn or
multi-OS runtime surface for the VM smoke tier.

## New infra needed

None. L1 rows extend the existing `session-status-visuals.test.ts` and the
folder component tests; L3 rows extend the existing Playwright suite against the
docker harness, whose port is read from `.pi-test-harness.json` (`dashboardPort`)
rather than hardcoded.

One caveat for the L3 author: several rows need a folder seeded with sessions in
specific states (errored, `ask_user`, retrying). Check `tests/e2e/` for an
existing seeding helper before building one — if none exists, that is fixture
work inside the existing harness, not a new level.
