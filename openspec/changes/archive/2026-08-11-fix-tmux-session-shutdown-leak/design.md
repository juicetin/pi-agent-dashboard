# Design — terminate the session process for every spawn strategy

## Evidence this design must satisfy

Sampled at one instant inside the E2E harness, mid-run:

```text
tmux panes:      21
resident pi:     21      (~127 MB RSS each)
server records:  0
memory.current:  2550 MiB / 4096 MiB, climbing
```

Any design that does not drive the first two numbers down while the third stays
flat has not fixed this.

## D1 — Where termination belongs: the server, not the caller

**Decision:** terminate inside `handleShutdown`/`handleForceKill`, keyed by the
session's recorded spawn strategy.

Rejected alternatives:

- **Let the E2E fixture kill tmux windows.** Wrong layer: it fixes the harness
  while every real tmux deployment keeps leaking, and it would make the suite
  pass while the product stays broken — the worst possible outcome, since the
  suite is what would otherwise reveal it.
- **Switch the default strategy to `headless`.** Hides the defect. Existing tmux
  deployments still leak, and the code path stays untested.
- **Rely on the advisory gateway `shutdown` message.** This is today's behaviour
  and is exactly what fails: it is a request, not a guarantee, and nothing checks
  the answer.

## D2 — One ladder, many handles

**Decision:** keep a single SIGTERM → grace → SIGKILL escalation (the one
`fix-keeper-kill-escalation` already established) and vary only *how the target
is resolved*:

| strategy | handle recorded at spawn | teardown |
|---|---|---|
| `headless` | PID (+ keeper PID) in `headlessPidRegistry` | existing `killBySessionId` |
| `tmux` | window/pane id **(nothing records this today)** | kill the window, then escalate on the pane's process |

The gap to close first is the missing handle: at present the server cannot name
the tmux window belonging to a session, which is why no teardown could exist.
Killing the window alone is also not sufficient on its own — a pane process that
ignores the hangup must still meet the ladder.

## D3 — Confirm before reporting removed

**Decision:** `session_removed` is broadcast after termination is confirmed; a
failure path emits a diagnostic naming the session and the surviving process.

This is the observability half of the bug and is independently valuable: it is
what would have surfaced the leak on day one instead of presenting as an
anonymous harness-memory mystery weeks later. Note the ordering constraint —
consumers treat `session_removed` as authoritative, so it must not be emitted
optimistically.

**Risk:** a confirmation wait makes shutdown slower, and the E2E reap awaits
`session_removed` per session. Bound the wait with the existing ladder's grace
rather than adding a second independent timeout, and keep failure non-blocking
(diagnose and move on) so one stuck session cannot stall a suite.

## D4 — Orphan detection is a first-class query

**Decision:** expose the "resident session processes vs live sessions" comparison
so it can be asserted, not just observed by a human running `docker exec`.

`scripts/probe-harness-memory.mjs` and `qa/tests/16-e2e-memory-bound.sh` (landed
by `fix-e2e-harness-memory-exhaustion`) already compute this out-of-band; test
P3 becomes meaningful only once divergence is supposed to be zero. This is what
makes a regression of this fix loud instead of silent.

## D5 — first declared superseded by D6, then REINSTATED by the harness

Task 1.1 read the spawn path. Both options this section originally offered are
wrong, for the same reason.

What `buildTmuxCommand` emits today
(`packages/server/src/spawn-process/process-manager.ts:242-252`):

```sh
tmux new-window  -t pi-dashboard -c <cwd> "cd <cwd> && pi <flags>"
tmux new-session -d -s pi-dashboard -c <cwd> "cd <cwd> && pi <flags>"
```

There is **no `-n` flag**, so every window takes tmux's default auto-generated
index. Nothing identifies which window belongs to which session.

The decisive constraint: **the session id does not exist at spawn time.** `pi`
mints it and the bridge registers it afterwards, so option (b) — derive the
window name from the session id — is impossible, and option (a) — a registry
keyed by session id, written at spawn — has no key to write.

**A correlation channel for exactly this problem already exists and is already
plumbed through tmux.** `mintSpawnToken()` → `PI_DASHBOARD_SPAWN_TOKEN` in the
spawned env (`process-manager.ts:208`, passed explicitly into the tmux pane at
:427) → the bridge echoes it back in `session_register.spawnToken`
(`packages/server/src/auth/spawn-token.ts`).

So:

1. Name the window from the token at spawn: `tmux new-window -n pi-<token> …`.
   The name is then knowable at spawn without knowing the session id.
2. On `session_register`, the server already receives `spawnToken` alongside the
   session id — record `sessionId → pi-<token>` there.
3. At shutdown, resolve the window and kill it, then escalate on the pane
   process with the shared ladder (D2).

This reuses a mechanism built for precisely this correlation instead of adding a
parallel one, and it keeps the spawn path's only new surface to a single `-n`
flag.

**Carry-overs to verify during implementation:**

- `buildTmuxCommand` is string-interpolated into `execSync`, and the repo already
  has tests pinning `shellEscape` for `cwd` and `sessionFile`. The token is a
  server-minted UUIDv4, but escape it on the same path rather than trusting the
  shape.
- A session with **no** token (resumed, recovered, or spawned before this change)
  has no window name. That path must degrade to today's behaviour and be
  reported, not silently treated as terminated — requirement C2 covers it.
- `wsl-tmux` builds on the same `buildTmuxCommand`, so it inherits the fix; the
  kill path must be reachable under WSL too.

## D6 — the real fix: `handleShutdown` must escalate to `session.pid`, as force-kill already does

Tasks 1.2/1.3 read both handlers. The defect is **not** "tmux sessions are
unreachable". It is that **one of the two shutdown paths forgot to use the PID it
already has**.

`handleForceKill`
(`packages/server/src/browser-handlers/session-action-handler.ts:766`) already
terminates a session under ANY spawn strategy:

```ts
const pid = session?.pid;                              // stored from session_register
const killResult = await killProcess(pid, { timeoutMs: 2000 });   // SIGTERM → 2s → SIGKILL
await headlessPidRegistry.killBySessionId(msg.sessionId);         // headless siblings too
```

`handleShutdown` (:625) does **not** reference `session.pid` at all:

```ts
piGateway.sendToSession(msg.sessionId, { type: "shutdown", … });  // advisory only
await headlessPidRegistry.killBySessionId(msg.sessionId);         // headless-only
killHeadlessBySessionId(msg.sessionId);                           // findPidByMarker → [] for tmux
sessionManager.unregister(…); broadcast({ type: "session_removed" … });  // unconditional
```

`killHeadlessBySessionId` resolves PIDs with `findPidByMarker(sessionId)`, a
process-table scan for the session id on the command line. A tmux pane runs
`cd <cwd> && pi <flags>` with no session id in it — pi mints the id later — so the
scan returns `[]` and the function reports `false`. Nothing else ever tries.

**Consequence, which also explains the pane count.** The panes were never the
leak; they are downstream of it. A pane runs the shell command
`cd <cwd> && pi`, so when pi exits the shell exits and tmux (default
`remain-on-exit off`) closes the window. 21 panes survived because 21 `pi`
processes survived. Kill pi and the pane goes with it — no tmux CLI required.

**The fix**, therefore, is to make shutdown finish what it starts:

1. Keep the graceful request — `sendToSession({type:"shutdown"})` — and give pi a
   bounded grace window to exit on its own. Shutdown is the *polite* path and
   must stay polite; the ladder is the backstop, not the opening move.
2. If the process is still alive after that window, escalate with the SAME
   `killProcess(session.pid, { timeoutMs: 2000 })` ladder force-kill uses.
3. Only then unregister and broadcast `session_removed` — and when the process
   still survives, emit the C2 diagnostic instead of reporting a clean removal.

This needs **no** change to `buildTmuxCommand`, no window naming, no new
registry, and no new correlation mechanism. It is strategy-agnostic by
construction: any session whose PID the server knows is terminable, which is
precisely the invariant `force-kill` has relied on all along.

**Why the two handlers diverged is itself the lesson.** Force-kill is *defined*
as "kill the process", so it was written against the PID. Shutdown is defined as
"ask the session to stop", and nobody checked what happens when the asking does
not work. Requirement C1 ("not removed until termination is confirmed") is what
stops that class of bug from recurring.

**Carry-overs:**

- The idle-reaper (`embed-lifecycle/idle-reaper.ts`) reclaims via
  `killBySessionId` — headless-only, so **tmux sessions are never idle-reclaimed
  either**. Same root cause, wider blast radius than shutdown alone. Verify
  whether it should route through the same escalation.
- PID reuse: force-kill already documents the `isPiProcess` caveat on Unix.
  Reuse its reasoning rather than inventing a second policy.
- A session with no stored PID (bridge never registered) must degrade to today's
  behaviour and report, not claim success.

## D7 — Reclaim what never registered (added during implementation)

**Decision:** when the spawn-register watchdog fires, terminate the spawned
process; do not merely report it.

The harness forced this. After D6 landed, the memory gate still failed (+29 %),
and the survivors were three tmux panes sitting on pi's interactive
"Trust project folder?" prompt for an untrusted cwd — zero open sockets, no
`session_register`, so no session record, so no shutdown, no reap, no
idle-reclaim. ~127 MB each, until the host restarts. The watchdog SAW every one
of them and did nothing.

Constraints discovered while building it, each of which broke a working-looking
implementation:

- **Narrow to leaf `pi`.** The token is an ordinary env var, so the tmux server,
  the dashboard's own node process and intervening shells all inherit it. An
  un-narrowed lookup returned five pids for one token; handing that set to the
  kill path took the container down. The probe filters on `comm == "pi"`, and
  the watchdog additionally refuses `process.pid` / `process.ppid`.
- **Force a zero exit on the /proc scan.** A shell `for` loop's status is the
  last iteration's, and the last `/proc` entry never matches, so `grep -q` left
  status 1 → `execSync` threw → the catch returned `[]` for every lookup. The
  watchdog fired and reclaimed nothing, silently.
- **Do not disarm a sibling spawn.** `arm()` replaced the prior entry for the
  same cwd, so three spawns into one directory produced one timeout for three
  leaks. An entry with its own token now keeps its timer; its own
  `clearByToken` cancels it when it registers.

Measured after: three deadlocked panes → three diagnostics → three reclaims →
panes 0, resident pi 0, container healthy. The memory gate then passed with
divergence 0 (P1 935→1020 MiB, P3 3 resident pi vs 3 live sessions).

**Risk accepted:** a dashboard-spawned session a human intended to answer
interactively (the trust prompt) is killed after `spawnRegisterTimeoutMs`
(default 30 s). This is the right trade for a *dashboard-owned* spawn — the
dashboard is where that session was supposed to appear, and it never did — and
the timeout is already operator-configurable. A pi the user starts themselves is
never armed and never touched.
