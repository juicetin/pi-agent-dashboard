## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tool-result error surfaces source severity colour from the shared tokens

The chat transcript's tool-result error surfaces SHALL source severity colour
from `--severity-*` tokens, not from raw Tailwind literals. The existing
no-raw-literals requirement enumerates `Toast.tsx`, `SpawnErrorToastHost.tsx`,
`SpawnErrorBanner.tsx`, `extension-ui/ToastSlot.tsx` and `NotifyRenderer.tsx`;
the tool-result renderers were omitted from that list and still ship raw
`red-300` / `red-400` / `red-500` / `red-950` literals. They are added to the
governed set:

- `tool-renderers/CtxToolRenderer.tsx` — the error card's border, fill and label
- `tool-renderers/AskUserToolRenderer.tsx` — the error icon and message
- `tool-renderers/AgentToolRenderer.tsx` — the subagent error line
- `chat/ToolBurstGroup.tsx` — the `N failed` badge
- `chat/BashOutputCard.tsx` — the non-zero `exit N` badge
- `chat/ToolCallStep.tsx` — the errored tool's status icon

These literals are dark-mode-tuned, so every one of these surfaces currently
clears the floor in dark mode and fails it in light mode.

#### Scenario: Component inspection finds no hardcoded severity colour
- **WHEN** the six governed tool-result components are inspected
- **THEN** severity backgrounds, borders, text and icon colours SHALL derive from `--severity-*` (directly or via a class map)
- **AND** SHALL NOT use raw `red-300` / `red-400` / `red-500` / `red-950` literals, with or without an alpha suffix

#### Scenario: A raw literal cannot re-enter a governed surface
- **WHEN** a raw `red-<NNN>` Tailwind literal is introduced into any file in the governed set
- **THEN** a static check SHALL fail and identify the file and line

#### Scenario: Non-error surfaces are unaffected
- **WHEN** files outside the governed set use raw red literals for non-severity purposes, such as a destructive-action button
- **THEN** the check SHALL NOT fail

### Requirement: Severity styles the chrome, not multi-line body content

An error surface whose body is **multi-line content** — a log dump, a command
transcript, a stack trace, tool output — SHALL carry its severity signal on the
container chrome (border, fill, and label) and SHALL render the body in the
normal code colours, `--text-secondary` on `--bg-code`.

An error surface that is a **badge or a bare status icon** SHALL take
`--severity-error-fg` for the whole element; no chrome/content split applies.

An error surface that is an **icon (or a literal `Error:` marker) followed by a
message** SHALL put `--severity-error-fg` on the icon/marker only and render the
message in `--text-secondary`. The icon/marker is the chrome; the message is
content. These surfaces carry no container fill or border, so the accent is
deliberately kept on the one element that is not the message itself — the error
signal is the icon/marker plus the message's own wording, not a tinted body.

Colouring an entire block of program output in the severity hue removes the
structure a reader needs, independently of whether the contrast ratio passes.
For a **contained** surface the fill, border and label are three redundant
channels for the error signal, so removing colour from the body does not weaken
it. For an icon-plus-message surface the redundancy is the icon plus the
message's wording instead; no container is introduced to manufacture it.

#### Scenario: Multi-line error body renders in code colours
- **GIVEN** a tool result parsed as an error whose message spans multiple lines
- **THEN** the body SHALL use `--text-secondary` on `--bg-code`
- **AND** the container SHALL use `--severity-error-bg` and `--severity-error-border`
- **AND** the label SHALL use `--severity-error-fg`

#### Scenario: The error signal survives without a coloured body
- **GIVEN** a multi-line error body rendered in code colours
- **THEN** the surface SHALL still convey the error state via at least the container fill, the container border, and a text label

#### Scenario: Badges and bare status icons take the accent directly
- **GIVEN** a badge or a bare status icon
- **THEN** it SHALL take `--severity-error-fg`, and no separate body treatment SHALL apply

#### Scenario: An icon-plus-message surface accents only the icon
- **GIVEN** an error surface composed of an icon or an `Error:` marker followed by a message
- **THEN** the icon or marker SHALL take `--severity-error-fg`
- **AND** the message SHALL take `--text-secondary`
- **AND** no container fill or border SHALL be added to the surface

#### Scenario: Collapsed detail blocks already follow the rule
- **GIVEN** an error card with a collapsible received-arguments block
- **THEN** that block SHALL use `--text-secondary` on `--bg-code`, unchanged by this requirement

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Derived triples meet a relative contrast gate across all themes

The derived `--severity-*` triples SHALL satisfy a **relative** contrast gate
across all 9 named themes (base, dracula, nord, github, catppuccin, tokyo-night,
rose-pine, solarized, gruvbox) in both light and dark modes (18 combos), computed
in a real browser that resolves `color-mix`, as specified below. An absolute
"AA 4.5:1 body everywhere" gate is unsatisfiable: adding color to text always
lowers its contrast below the pure base text, and 5 of 18 theme·mode combos
already ship sub-AA base body text (`--text-secondary` on `--bg-tertiary`:
catppuccin/light, tokyo-night/light, rose-pine/light, solarized/dark,
solarized/light). A derived tint can never beat the tokens it derives from —
hence the relative gate:

- Each accent tier's `-fg` on its `-bg` SHALL clear a **3:1 legibility floor** (a
  minimum legibility bar, NOT a body-text AA claim; the severity color is a
  redundant cue alongside the icon + message text). Full WCAG AA 4.5:1 SHALL be
  met on the majority of cells. Accent cells in [3.0, 4.5) are intentional,
  documented sub-AA exceptions, not AA-compliant body text.
- `neutral` SHALL equal the theme's own `--text-secondary`-on-`--bg-tertiary`
  contrast (it reuses those literal tokens), so it is never worse than the theme
  already ships.
- Borders are decorative (the filled `-bg` identifies the component,
  WCAG 1.4.11) and are NOT held to a contrast floor.
- ONE documented exception is permitted: tokyo-night light `info` (a blue tier on
  a theme whose own body text is blue and already ~3.5:1), measured ~2.7:1; the
  gate asserts ≥ 2.5:1 to leave browser-rounding margin.

The gate SHALL additionally cover the governed **tool-result error surfaces**.
Each such surface's resolved foreground against its own resolved background SHALL
clear the same 3:1 floor in every theme and mode. No additional exception is
introduced for them.

#### Scenario: Every tier clears its floor in every theme/mode
- **WHEN** each of the five tiers renders in each of the 18 theme×mode combos
- **THEN** its `-fg`/`-bg` contrast SHALL be ≥ 3:1 (accent tiers) or ≥ the theme's own `--text-secondary`-on-`--bg-tertiary` ratio (`neutral`), except the documented tokyo-night/light `info` cell (≥ 2.5:1)

#### Scenario: Tool-result error surfaces clear the floor in every theme/mode
- **WHEN** the ctx error card, the `N failed` badge, the `exit N` badge, the errored tool-step icon, the ask_user error message and the subagent error line render in each of the 18 theme×mode combos
- **THEN** each surface's resolved foreground against its own resolved background SHALL be ≥ 3:1
- **AND** no light-mode cell SHALL measure below the floor
