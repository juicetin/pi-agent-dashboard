## Purpose

Lets one automation declare multiple actions — each with its own flow or skill — so a single trigger fire expands into several concurrent sessions instead of one, under an explicit bound on how many sessions a fire may start.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: An automation MAY declare multiple actions

An `automation.yaml` SHALL accept either a single `action:` block or an `actions:` list. Each `actions:` entry SHALL be a complete action specification of the same shape as `action:` (`kind` plus its `prompt` / `skill` / `payload` fields), so distinct entries MAY select distinct flows or skills. `action:` and `actions:` SHALL be mutually exclusive.

#### Scenario: Two different actions declared

- **WHEN** an automation declares `actions:` with entry 1 `kind: flows.run` (flow A) and entry 2 `kind: core.skill` (skill B)
- **THEN** the automation SHALL parse as valid
- **AND** the fire SHALL produce one child per entry, each dispatched with its own action

#### Scenario: Single action stays single

- **WHEN** an automation declares only the legacy single `action:` block and no `count`
- **THEN** a fire SHALL produce exactly one child, behaving identically to the pre-fan-out behavior

#### Scenario: Both forms declared is invalid

- **WHEN** an automation declares BOTH `action:` and `actions:`
- **THEN** parsing SHALL fail with a validation error naming the conflict
- **AND** the automation SHALL be isolated as invalid without affecting other automations

#### Scenario: Empty or malformed actions list is invalid

- **WHEN** `actions:` is present but empty, or an entry has an unregistered `kind`
- **THEN** parsing SHALL fail with a validation error identifying the offending entry index

#### Scenario: An invalid actions entry cannot be persisted

- **WHEN** an automation is created or updated with an `actions:` entry whose `kind` is unregistered
- **THEN** the write SHALL be rejected with an error naming the offending entry index
- **AND** no configuration SHALL be persisted that a subsequent listing would report as invalid

### Requirement: An action entry MAY declare a spawn count

Each action entry SHALL accept an optional integer `count` (default `1`, minimum `1`) specifying how many sessions to spawn for that entry within a single fire. Each counted session SHALL be an independent child of the same fire with an identical action specification. The single `action:` block SHALL be treated as an action entry for this purpose, so `count` SHALL be honored there identically.

#### Scenario: Count on the single action block

- **WHEN** an automation declares a single `action:` block with `count: 3`
- **THEN** the fire SHALL spawn 3 children of that action

#### Scenario: Count expands one entry into N children

- **WHEN** an entry declares `count: 3`
- **THEN** the fire SHALL spawn 3 children for that entry
- **AND** each child SHALL receive the same dispatch and be tracked separately

#### Scenario: Invalid count rejected

- **WHEN** `count` is `0`, negative, or non-integer
- **THEN** parsing SHALL fail with a validation error

### Requirement: Children of one fire spawn concurrently

All children resolved from a single trigger fire SHALL be spawned concurrently, independent of the automation's `concurrency` policy. The `concurrency` policy (`skip` | `queue` | `parallel`) SHALL continue to govern OVERLAPPING FIRES of the same automation, evaluated against the parent occurrence.

#### Scenario: Children run in parallel regardless of policy

- **WHEN** an automation with `concurrency: skip` and 4 resolved children fires once
- **THEN** all 4 children SHALL be spawned without waiting for one another
- **AND** every child's spawn SHALL be initiated before any child has finalized

#### Scenario: Overlapping fire policy applies to the parent

- **WHEN** an automation with `concurrency: skip` fires again while its previous parent occurrence is still running
- **THEN** the new fire SHALL be dropped
- **AND** no additional children SHALL be spawned

### Requirement: Concurrent spawns per fire SHALL be bounded

A maximum number of children a single fire may spawn SHALL be enforced. The bound SHALL be configurable per automation and SHALL fall back to a dashboard settings default when the automation does not declare one. The bound SHALL be an integer of at least `1`; a `0`, negative, or non-integer bound SHALL fail validation. No upper cap SHALL be imposed. A fire resolving more children than the bound SHALL spawn up to the bound and record the excess as a bounded-truncation warning on the parent run rather than failing the fire. Truncation SHALL keep the FIRST children in resolution order — action entries in declaration order, and within an entry by ascending `count` index — so the surviving set is deterministic.

#### Scenario: Resolved children exceed the bound

- **WHEN** a fire resolves 10 children and the effective bound is 4
- **THEN** exactly 4 children SHALL be spawned
- **AND** they SHALL be the first 4 in resolution order
- **AND** the parent run SHALL record a warning naming the bound and the number not spawned

#### Scenario: Invalid bound rejected

- **WHEN** `maxConcurrentSpawns` is `0`, negative, or non-integer
- **THEN** parsing SHALL fail with a validation error

#### Scenario: Per-automation bound overrides the settings default

- **WHEN** the settings default bound is 4 and the automation declares a bound of 2
- **THEN** at most 2 children SHALL be spawned per fire

#### Scenario: Bound within limit is not surfaced

- **WHEN** a fire resolves 2 children under a bound of 4
- **THEN** both SHALL spawn
- **AND** no truncation warning SHALL be recorded
