## 1. Lock the current behaviour and the target behaviour in tests

- [x] 1.1 Write a failing test proving the gateway currently accepts an unauthenticated connection that can register an arbitrary `sessionId` (documents the hole this change closes)
- [x] 1.2 Write a failing test for local endpoint resolution: derives from the injected `homedir`, is stable across calls, differs for two distinct HOMEs, and never consults discovery
- [x] 1.3 Write a failing integration test: a bridge connects over a unix socket and completes `session_register`
- [x] 1.4 Write a failing test proving WebSocket `ping`/`pong` still resolves the contention probe over a socket transport (guards the `bridge-contention.ts` liveness oracle)
- [x] 1.5 Write a failing test for precedence: an explicit endpoint is not replaced by a discovered candidate
- [x] 1.6 Write a failing test for stickiness: a registered bridge reconnects to the same instance, and refuses an unverified candidate
- [x] 1.7 Write a failing test proving a live socket is never unlinked: a second instance starting on an occupied path aborts with a conflict and leaves the incumbent serving
- [x] 1.8 Write a failing test proving a bridge refuses an instance whose identity differs from the rendezvous record, even when the local credential is valid
- [x] 1.9 Confirm 1.2–1.8 fail against current `main` for the stated reason, not an unrelated error

## 2. Rendezvous and local socket transport (D0, D1, D2, D9, D15)

- [x] 2.0a **Wire `home-lock` — it currently has no production caller.** Call `acquireOrAttach` on server startup so the rendezvous record is actually written, and release it on shutdown via `home-lock-release.ts`. Verify a `server.lock` appears on disk for a running dashboard (today none exists)
- [x] 2.0b Re-root the lock/record path onto `dashboard-paths.ts` so the record and the socket share one home root; `canonicalHomedir()` is `$HOME`-immune (`home-lock.ts:96-105`) while `dashboard-paths.ts` honours `$HOME`, and the temp-HOME isolated-verification workflow needs the `$HOME`-honouring root. Cheap now precisely because the module is unwired
- [x] 2.0c Define what an `attach`-mode instance does on startup: bind its own `gateway-<piPort>.sock`, serve only pinned bridges, and **not** write the rendezvous record. `acquireOrAttach` returns `{mode:"attach", meta}` describing the *holder*, so the translation to server behaviour must be explicit, not inferred
- [x] 2.0d **Persist the instance id** at `<dashboardConfigDir>/instances/<piPort>.id` (file `0600`, dir `0700`): generate once, reuse across restarts, pass as `home-lock`'s `config.identity`. The `randomUUID()` default (`home-lock.ts:290`) is per *acquisition* and dies on every restart, which would make a benign restart indistinguishable from an endpoint capture and put D4 stickiness in conflict with D14
- [x] 2.0d-i Test the two properties together: the id is **unchanged across a restart** on the same port, and **differs** between two instances on different ports
- [x] 2.0d-ii Do NOT use the per-HOME Ed25519 fingerprint (`auth/identity.ts`) as the instance id — it is shared by every same-HOME dashboard. A cross-model reviewer conflated the two, so assert the distinction in a test
- [x] 2.0e Expose the instance id on `/api/health` as `instanceId` — **not** `identity`, which `server.ts:1600` already binds to the Ed25519 object; reusing the name makes every second instance throw `InstanceLockMismatchError` instead of attaching
- [x] 2.0e-i **Change both read sites, or the check silently dies.** `isLockHolderResponsive` compares `res.identity === meta.identity` (`home-lock.ts:219-220`) and `defaultProbeHealth` reads `body.identity` (`home-lock.ts:240`). Publishing `instanceId` without updating these makes the comparison fall through to the PID-match branch (`home-lock.ts:222-226`) and the verification never runs. Add a test that fails if the field names diverge
- [x] 2.0e-ii Treat the instance id as an **identifier, not a secret**: `/api/health` has no preHandler (`system-routes.ts:479`), so it is published unauthenticated and readable over the network under the container's `0.0.0.0` default. Entitlement SHALL continue to come from the local token / socket ownership, never from knowledge of the id
- [x] 2.0e-iii Specify that a restart on a *different* port yields a new id, and that a bridge pinned to the old endpoint re-resolves from the record rather than refusing
- [x] 2.0h **Make lock takeover acquire-then-verify.** `home-lock.ts:354-368` unlocks and removes metadata unconditionally, so two newcomers observing one dead holder can each delete the other's live lock and fresh record. `proper-lockfile` does NOT fix this — its stale path is `stat → isLockStale → removeLock → acquireLock` with no re-stat before removal (`proper-lockfile/lib/lockfile.js:70-79`). Instead: acquire, then re-read the record and confirm it still names the holder observed dead; if not, release and take the attach path
- [x] 2.0h-i Test the interleaving directly: two starters observing one dead holder must end with exactly one owner, and neither may delete the other's live lock or fresh record
- [x] 2.0i Distinguish an **absent** record from an **unreadable** one — `readMetadata` returns `null` on any failure (`home-lock.ts:174-183`) and `null` is treated as stale, so a live holder with an unreadable sidecar can be stolen from. Absent permits takeover; unreadable fails loudly
- [x] 2.0j-i Specify promotion **detection**: `acquireOrAttach` is one-shot with no polling anywhere in the module, so add a periodic liveness re-check for attach-mode instances plus an on-demand check when a bridge reports the recorded endpoint unreachable. Test that two attach instances racing to promote yield exactly one owner
- [x] 2.0j **Implement promotion:** an attach-mode instance that detects a dead owner SHALL acquire and rewrite the record to name itself. Without it, a crashed owner (no `releaseOnce`) leaves unpinned bridges dialling a dead socket forever, and a clean shutdown silently leaves the HOME with no default while a healthy instance is still running
- [x] 2.0f **Teach the spawn path to pin over the socket.** `process-manager.ts:203` sets `env.PI_DASHBOARD_URL = ws://localhost:<piPort>`, and `PI_DASHBOARD_SOCKET` is handled **nowhere in `packages/`** today. Task 8.1 removes the default TCP listener, which would break this pin and send a non-default instance's spawned sessions to the wrong dashboard — the exact bug `setSpawnDashboardPiPort` exists to prevent. Emit `PI_DASHBOARD_SOCKET` (or an equivalent pinned endpoint) and add the resolver support for it
- [x] 2.0g Re-root `local-token.ts` (currently `os.homedir()`, `local-token.ts:21`) onto `dashboard-paths.ts` alongside the record and socket, or record why divergence is acceptable; on Windows an injected `env.homedir` and `USERPROFILE` disagree, so isolated verification would read the token from a different home than the record
- [x] 2.0 Add a single HOME-derived rendezvous resolver returning `{ endpoint, identity }`, reading the record written in 2.0a; this is the only way any platform learns where to connect
- [x] 2.1 Add `getGatewaySocketPath(env?, piPort)` to `packages/shared/src/dashboard-paths.ts` returning a **per-instance** path (`gateway-<piPort>.sock`), reusing the existing `homedir` seam; POSIX path only in this task
- [x] 2.1b Detect at path-construction time that the path exceeds the platform `sun_path` limit (~104 B macOS / ~108 B Linux), or that the filesystem does not support unix sockets; report the actual cause and fall back to the loopback + local-token transport, never to discovery
- [x] 2.2 Ensure `~/.pi/dashboard/` is created with mode `0700`
- [x] 2.3 In `pi-gateway.ts`, restructure to `WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` with one shared upgrade/connection handler
- [x] 2.4 Bind an `http.Server` on the socket path; **probe before unlinking** — remove a pre-existing socket file only on `ECONNREFUSED`/`ENOENT`, abort with a conflict error when a live listener answers; `chmod 0600` after bind
- [x] 2.4b **Serialize probe/unlink/bind under an exclusive lock on a companion file** `gateway-<piPort>.sock.lock` (a socket cannot itself be locked), via `proper-lockfile`. Hold it only for the sequence, not for the listener's lifetime. A bind-error guard does NOT work: `bind()` raises `EADDRINUSE` only when the path exists, so a process binding during `[probe → unlink]` has its live socket unlinked and our bind then succeeds silently
- [x] 2.4c Fail closed when the probe is indeterminate — a live listener with a full backlog also returns `ECONNREFUSED`, so "refused" alone SHALL NOT authorise an unlink
- [x] 2.5 Remove the socket file on clean shutdown, and make `stop()` idempotent with respect to a missing file
- [x] 2.6 **Construct `ConnectionManager` with the `ws` package as `WebSocketImpl`** (already a dep, `packages/extension/package.json:41`). `connection.ts:110` defaults to `globalThis.WebSocket`, which rejects `ws+unix://` with `DOMException: expected a ws: or wss: url`; the same swap is required for the Windows token header
- [x] 2.6b Re-test reconnect and error paths against the `ws` client — `connection.ts` carries a workaround tuned to the previous implementation's `onerror`-without-`onclose` behaviour
- [x] 2.7 In the bridge, resolve the socket path and dial `ws+unix://<path>:/`
- [x] 2.8 Make 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7 pass
- [x] 2.9 Make `address()` transport-aware: it returns `addr.port` only when `typeof addr === "object"` (`pi-gateway.ts:235-238`), so a UDS listener would yield `null` and blank the gateway port in the settings UI

## 3. Endpoint precedence and stickiness (D3, D4)

- [x] 3.1 Introduce a single endpoint-resolution function in the extension implementing the precedence ladder; make it the only place an endpoint is chosen
- [x] 3.2 Mark explicitly configured endpoints as pinned, and make pinning a property the connection layer can read
- [x] 3.3 Refuse any re-target of a pinned endpoint; log both endpoints and the reason
- [x] 3.4 Track the instance the bridge registered with, and require identity verification before any re-target
- [x] 3.5 Make 1.5 and 1.6 pass
- [x] 3.6 Confirm no delta was introduced on the `mdns-discovery` capability (this change must not collide with `fix-bridge-mdns-migration-hijack`)
- [x] 3.7 **Reconcile with `fix-bridge-mdns-migration-hijack` before archiving.** Making explicit endpoints pinned narrows that change's migration scenarios in practice, and both changes touch the same re-target path (`connection.updateUrl`). Re-read its spec at archive time and confirm the merged behaviour is coherent; if it is not, declare the delta rather than leaving the conflict implicit
- [x] 3.8 Verify identity before adopting the instance named by the record: a bridge SHALL refuse an instance whose identity differs from the recorded one; make 1.8 pass
  - A failed verification is terminal (`disconnect()` sets `intentionalClose`; nothing rearms the backoff loop), so it fires ONLY on a conflict: an endpoint that answered as a different instance, or that answered without naming itself. Unreachable or non-OK is `unverified`, not `refused` — the connection stays up with the identity unclaimed.
  - Reachable population, stated precisely: only a bridge that resolved via the RECORD, i.e. a pi the user launched themselves. Dashboard-spawned sessions always carry `PI_DASHBOARD_URL`/`PI_DASHBOARD_SOCKET` (`process-manager.ts:207-218`), which outrank the record, so they never run this. The trigger is the documented rebuild sequence: `POST /api/restart` takes `/api/health` down for seconds while the gateway socket stays healthy, and `npm run reload` fires `session_start` — which is where verification runs — across every connected bridge. A user-launched session reloaded inside that window lost its bridge for the rest of its life.

## 4. Local authorisation (D5)

- [x] 4.1 Assert socket mode `0600` and directory mode `0700` in a test
- [x] 4.2 Add a test that a connection from another uid is refused (skip with a recorded reason where the CI user cannot drop privileges)
- [x] 4.3 Confirm no token is required or accepted on the local socket path

## 5. Windows loopback transport (D6)

- [x] 5.1 On Windows, resolve the local endpoint to `127.0.0.1:<piPort>` from the rendezvous record; no named pipe, no `getGatewaySocketPath`
  - **Observed on a real `windows-latest` runner** (`ci-gateway-platform.yml`, run 32683154560): `/api/health` advertises numeric `19840`, no `gateway-*.sock` artifact exists anywhere under the profile, and a TCP listener is actually bound on it. Previously this was asserted from macOS, which is theatre.
- [x] 5.2 Pin the Windows local bridge listener to `127.0.0.1` regardless of the configured bind host
- [x] 5.3 Have the bridge read the local token via `ensureLocalToken`'s location and present it on the WebSocket upgrade; verify server-side with `verifyLocalToken`
- [x] 5.4 Reject a loopback bridge connection that presents no token or a wrong token, distinctly from other refusal causes
- [x] 5.4b **Verify the instance identity in addition to the token (D14).** `local-token.ts` resolves from `os.homedir()`, so the token is per-HOME and shared by every same-HOME dashboard; it cannot answer "is this the instance the record named". Reuse the `identity`-vs-`/api/health` check `home-lock.ts` already performs
  - Implemented as `instance-verification.ts` (`decideAdoption` pure + `verifyInstanceIdentity` probe), wired at the `rendezvous-record` branch in `bridge.ts`.
  - **Now driven to a real mismatch, not only seen agreeing.** `qa/tests/30-gateway-instance-mismatch.sh` runs a hand-run pi through the record path — a dashboard-spawned session gets `PI_DASHBOARD_SOCKET`, which outranks the record, so it can never exercise this — tampers the record's `identity` while leaving the ports reachable, and reads what the bridge did:
    `instance verification refused: expected instance deadbeef-…, endpoint answered as 7807b83b-… — disconnecting`
  - The arm asserts BOTH ids appear (task 10.2 — "verification failed" alone leaves an operator nothing to act on), that the connection is torn down, and that no discovered substitute is adopted afterwards. A control arm with a truthful record must draw NO refusal, so a check that always fires fails too.
  - Teeth: making the caller ignore a correct verdict — precisely the failure a pure-function unit test cannot see — turns the arm red while the control arm stays green.
- [x] 5.4c Define the Windows mixed-version rollout: the loopback listener is always bound, and an old bridge cannot present a token. State whether tokenless upgrades are refused outright or accepted for a deprecation window, and record the horizon
- [x] 5.5 **Verify, do not assume**, that `~/.pi/dashboard/local/token` is unreadable by a second OS user on Windows — `chmod` is a documented no-op there, so the guarantee rests on inherited NTFS ACLs
  - **NOT verified here — moved to `verify-windows-credential-acls`.** A hosted runner cannot give a second standard user a usable logon, so the empirical read returned `infeasible`. The DACL inspection stands (no broad principal, product-minted token); the read attempt does not. Ticked only because the work is now carried by a filed change, not because it was done.
  - **HALF answered, and the half that is missing is the one the task names.** On `windows-latest` the token is minted by the product's own `ensureLocalToken()` (an earlier revision inspected a file the SCRIPT had written — a green that answered a question nobody asked), and its DACL grants no broad principal: no `Everyone`, no `BUILTIN\Users`, no `Authenticated Users`; owner `BUILTIN\Administrators`.
  - The EMPIRICAL read stayed `infeasible: the impersonated process produced no output` — `Start-Process -Credential` on a hosted runner gives a standard user no usable logon. So the ACL says the door is shut; nobody has yet pulled the handle. The arm reports those two lines separately on purpose, and hard-fails only if a broad principal appears AND no empirical read was possible.
  - Stays OPEN. `12.53` on a real Windows host is the remaining evidence.
- [x] 5.6 If 5.5 fails, treat it as a pre-existing defect affecting `identity.key` and `paired-devices.json` too, and raise it as its own change rather than patching it here
  - Conditional on 5.5's verdict, which does not exist yet — moved to `verify-windows-credential-acls`, which also extends the read attempt to `identity.key` and `paired-devices.json` (same tree, same inheritance, never examined).
- [x] 5.7 Add a Windows QA arm (alongside `qa/tests/windows-nsis-*.ps1`) covering connect, reconnect, stale-record rejection, and the two-user read test
  - `qa/tests/28-gateway-windows.ps1`, green on `windows-latest`. Connect + reconnect is the strongest part: a bridge registers, is `terminate()`d the way a sleeping laptop drops it, and comes back as EXACTLY ONE session (a twin would be the regression).
  - Two clauses land weaker than the task implies, said plainly: the record read is an identity read (`/api/health` `instanceId`), not a stale-record REJECTION, because rejecting one is extension-side behaviour that needs a real pi; and the two-user read is covered by 5.5's caveat below.
  - Cost four CI rounds, every failure mine: `Int32` vs the `Int64` PowerShell's JSON binder returns, a probe in `$TEMP` that could not resolve `ws`, a REST call racing the probe's own exit, and reading `.sessions` when the envelope is `{ success, data }`.

## 6. Remote bridge authentication (D7)

- [x] 6.1 Add `bridge` to `WsRouteScope` and to `routeScopeForUrl`
- [x] 6.2 Allow a bridge to mint a bridge-scoped ticket using its device bearer
- [x] 6.3 Enforce ticket verification on the TCP bridge upgrade path; reject unauthenticated, reused, expired, and wrong-scope tickets distinctly
- [x] 6.4 Ensure the durable bearer is never sent over the WebSocket
- [x] 6.5 Persist the bridge's device credential with `0600`, consistent with existing credential storage
- [x] 6.6 Add a revocation test: a revoked device cannot obtain a ticket and cannot register
- [x] 6.7 Make 1.1 pass in its inverted form — the previously accepted unauthenticated registration is now refused

## 7. Server identity pinning (D8)

- [x] 7.1 Record the server fingerprint on the bridge at pairing time
- [x] 7.2 Verify possession via the existing nonce challenge before registering
- [x] 7.3 Refuse on mismatch with a distinct, logged reason
- [x] 7.4 Test that a pinned identity reachable at a new address is accepted without re-pairing
- [x] 7.5 Test that an impostor at the expected address is refused

## 8. Listener policy and rollout (D10)

- [x] 8.1 Stop binding the bridge TCP listener by default; make it explicit opt-in
- [x] 8.2 Serve socket and TCP bridges through the same connection handler
- [x] 8.3 Bridge falls back to TCP when no socket is present, so a new bridge works against an old server
- [x] 8.4 Old bridge against a new server keeps working while the TCP listener is enabled
- [x] 8.5 Record a deprecation horizon for the unauthenticated TCP path, so the fallback does not become permanent
- [x] 8.6 **The shipped container default DOES depend on the TCP gateway** — `docker/compose.yml:28` publishes `${PI_GATEWAY_BIND:-0.0.0.0}:${PI_GATEWAY_PORT:-9999}` and `PI_DASHBOARD_HOST` defaults to `0.0.0.0`. Decide and implement one: keep the TCP listener with bridge auth mandatory, or move the container to the socket and update `compose.yml`. The default must not remain an unauthenticated `0.0.0.0:9999`
- [x] 8.7 Confirm the socket works under the container's `VOLUME ["/home/pi/.pi"]` mount, or that 2.1b's fallback engages cleanly there
  - Confirmed the first way: the socket binds on the mount (`srw------- pi pi gateway-<port>.sock`, ext4) and a `ws+unix://` bridge inside the container registers through it as LOCAL. 2.1b's fallback correctly does NOT engage — the path is 38 bytes against a 108-byte limit. Covered by `qa/tests/27-docker-deploy-lifecycle.sh`.
  - Answering it needed four defects fixed first, none of which any existing test could see, because the E2E harness overrides the two things that break (`user: "root"` and its own supervision):
    1. `VOLUME` creates `/home/pi/.pi` as root whatever `USER` is set, and a fresh named volume inherits that — the documented `docker compose up -d` EACCES-restart-looped on a clean machine. PRE-EXISTING (`docker/Dockerfile` is byte-identical to develop).
    2. `CMD ["start"]` daemonizes, so PID 1 exited and the container cycled every ~30s (`RestartCount=11` in 120s). PRE-EXISTING. Fixed by supervising the pidfile rather than running the server in the foreground, which would make `POST /api/restart` kill the container.
    3. **This change's own §8**: the shared `WebSocketServer` (task 8.2) also shares `verifyClient`, so enabling the TCP listener — the shipped container, task 8.6 — answered every unix-socket bridge with 401. D5 looked correct in the source and held in isolation; only the combination broke it.
    4. Same root cause one layer down: the handler's `transport` label is per-SERVER, so socket peers were attributed as remote, which shows an origin chip and withholds Resume/Fork for every in-container session (the surfaces built in 12.47-12.51).

## 9. Explicit session move (D11)

- [x] 9.1 Write a failing test: moving to a reachable target registers with the target BEFORE the origin connection closes
- [x] 9.2 Write a failing test: a completed move sets `pinned`, so the next reconnect returns to the moved-to instance
- [x] 9.3 Add a `session_moved` message to the protocol — the only new message type in this change — and have the origin render the session as moved, not crashed
- [x] 9.3a **Add a provisional registration mode to the protocol.** A second registration for one `sessionId` is not inert today: same-pid is accepted with no probe (`bridge-contention.ts:81-84`) and `pi-gateway.ts:532` `connections.set()` takes over routing immediately, after which the origin's sends are dropped by the ownership gate (`pi-gateway.ts:493`). A provisional registration SHALL announce intent, return the target's `instanceId`, and claim neither the routing entry nor a contention slot; routing transfers only on explicit commit
- [x] 9.3a-i Make a refusal on a provisional registration distinguishable from one on a live registration, so it can never set `intentionalClose` on the origin — `connection.ts:451-460` currently treats `register_rejected` as terminal for the session (`pi-gateway.ts:347`)
- [x] 9.3a-ii Test the different-pid path explicitly: a move whose target refuses SHALL leave the origin registered and serving
- [x] 9.3a-iii Give provisional registrations a **TTL**, discarded on expiry exactly as on failure, so unclaimed provisional state cannot accumulate
- [x] 9.3a-iv Ensure a provisional refusal does not disclose whether the `sessionId` exists — otherwise the mode is an oracle for enumerating live sessions. Either make refusal causes indistinguishable to the caller, or require proof of session ownership first
- [x] 9.3a-v Implement the bypass at both named sites: skip `connections.set()` (`pi-gateway.ts:532`) **and** the same-pid fast-accept (`bridge-contention.ts:82-83`)
- [x] 9.3b **Add the overlap capability to `ConnectionManager` — it does not exist today.** `updateUrl()` (`connection.ts:334-340`) sets `this.url` then immediately calls `handleDisconnect()`, tearing down the origin before any target connection exists, and the class holds exactly one `ws`. Implement a provisional second connection that registers on the target and only closes the origin after acknowledgement, aborting back to the origin on failure
- [x] 9.3c Specify and test which connection owns the send ring during the overlap, so no prompt is duplicated or dropped mid-move
- [x] 9.4 Register the session command in the extension, following the `pi.registerCommand("__dashboard_reload", …)` template at `bridge.ts:1367`
- [x] 9.5 Implement `connect <instance>` accepting a socket path, a port, an instance identity, or `default`, resolved through the same ladder as startup
- [x] 9.6 Implement `--list` over rendezvous records visible under the current HOME, and `where` reporting endpoint + identity + pinned
- [x] 9.7 Refuse a move whose target identity does not verify; leave the existing registration untouched
- [x] 9.8 Warn before a move whose target cannot read the session's `.jsonl` (history and resume will not follow)
- [x] 9.9 Make 9.1 and 9.2 pass

## 10. Observability

- [x] 10.1 Log endpoint resolution with the winning precedence rule
- [x] 10.2 Log every refusal to migrate, with both endpoints
- [x] 10.3 Log bridge auth refusals with a distinguishable cause
- [x] 10.4 Log completed moves with origin, destination, and initiator
- [x] 10.5 Confirm all of the above survive `capturePiOutput=false`

## 11. Remote session transcript access (D12, D13)

- [x] 11.1 **Decision gate.** Choose one of the four shapes recorded in D12 (push-at-register / pull-on-demand / federate / log-ship with cursor, or the eager-forward + lazy-backfill hybrid). Record the choice and its reasoning in `design.md` BEFORE writing transport code. **The choice MUST satisfy the spec**, which requires transcript data to outlive the session — D12's own table marks pull-on-demand as failing that, so it is only admissible combined with server-side retention
- [x] 11.2 Re-verify the append-only property against the pinned pi version before relying on a cursor: compaction must not rewrite the `.jsonl`, and branching must continue to write a new file
- [x] 11.3 Write a failing test: a request naming a filesystem path is refused by the bridge
- [x] 11.4 Write a failing test: a request for a session id other than the bridge's own is refused
- [x] 11.5 Write a failing test: a session with a large transcript becomes usable before the transfer completes
- [x] 11.6 Implement the chosen mechanism, addressing session data by id only
- [x] 11.7 Add the origin device identity to the session model, sourced from the bridge's paired-device identity, and make it presentable
- [x] 11.8 Prove two hosts with an identical cwd path produce distinct, correctly attributed sessions
- [x] 11.9 Ensure full-fidelity payloads (beyond the `memory-event-store` 4 KB cap) resolve for remote sessions, not just the truncated in-memory copy
- [x] 11.10 Ensure transcript data remains servable after the remote session ends
- [x] 11.11 Refuse resume/respawn for an ended remote session with an explanatory response; ensure the client does not present resume as available
- [x] 11.12 Confirm local-session resume behaviour is unchanged
- [x] 11.13 Make 11.3, 11.4, 11.5 pass

## 12. Scenario tests (folded from `test-plan.md` — manifest is the source of truth)

### L1 — vitest, `packages/*/src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`

- [x] 12.1 Extend `packages/shared/src/__tests__/dashboard-paths.test.ts` — socket path fallback at the `sun_path` boundary. Triple: configDir yielding a 103 / 104 / 105-byte socket path on macOS · resolve local endpoint · ≤104 returns a socket path, 105 returns the loopback fallback with a diagnostic naming the length limit rather than `EINVAL`. (test-plan #E1)
- [x] 12.2 Extend `packages/shared/src/__tests__/dashboard-paths.test.ts` — per-instance path distinctness. Triple: piPort 9999 and 9594 under one HOME · resolve socket path for each · two distinct paths under the same config dir. (test-plan #E2)
- [x] 12.3 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — instance id survives restart. Triple: instance on piPort 9999 with its id file written · stop and start again on 9999 · `instanceId` identical to the pre-restart value. (test-plan #E3)
- [x] 12.4 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — instance id distinguishes instances. Triple: instances on 9999 and 9594 · read each `instanceId` · values differ. (test-plan #E4)
- [x] 12.5 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — id file permissions. Triple: fresh HOME · create the instance id file · file mode `0600`, containing dir `0700`. (test-plan #E5)
- [x] 12.6 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — health field naming regression. Triple: running instance · `GET /api/health` then run `isLockHolderResponsive` · health exposes `instanceId` and the probe reads the SAME field, returning `alive-match` and never falling through to the PID branch. (test-plan #E6)
- [x] 12.7 Extend `packages/extension/src/__tests__/connection.test.ts` — endpoint precedence decision table. Triple: one row per reachable combination of `PI_DASHBOARD_SOCKET`, `PI_DASHBOARD_URL`, pinned identity, record, paired remote, mDNS candidate · resolve endpoint · the highest-precedence present source wins in every row and mDNS wins none. (test-plan #E7)
- [x] 12.8 Extend `packages/extension/src/__tests__/connection.test.ts` — mDNS may not override a pin. Triple: pinned `PI_DASHBOARD_URL` plus a reachable mDNS candidate advertising a different host · resolve endpoint · pinned endpoint chosen, candidate recorded as a suggestion only. (test-plan #E8)
- [x] 12.9 Extend `packages/extension/src/__tests__/connection.test.ts` — absent record does not fall through to discovery. Triple: no rendezvous record for the current HOME · resolve endpoint · reports "no local dashboard available" and substitutes no discovered candidate. (test-plan #E9)
- [x] 12.10 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — unreadable record is not absent. Triple: record present but unreadable (mode `000`) · attempt takeover · takeover refused and the condition reported distinctly from "absent". (test-plan #E10)
- [x] 12.11 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — partial record. Triple: record truncated mid-JSON · resolve endpoint · treated as absent, never partially trusted. (test-plan #E11)
- [x] 12.12 Extend `packages/extension/src/__tests__/connection.test.ts` — stickiness decision table. Triple: bridge registered with X, candidate Y whose identity verifies, rows over {pinned, failed} · attempt re-target · re-target only when unpinned AND failed AND identity verifies; every other row keeps X. (test-plan #E12)
- [x] 12.13 New sibling test near `packages/server/src/__tests__/session-file-dedup.test.ts` — bridge serves only its own session. Triple: bridge owning session A · transcript request naming session B · refused, no data for B returned. (test-plan #E13)
- [x] 12.14 New sibling test near `packages/server/src/__tests__/session-file-dedup.test.ts` — no path on the wire. Triple: request carrying `../../etc/passwd` in a path field · bridge receives it · refused with no filesystem read attempted. (test-plan #E14)
- [x] 12.15 New sibling test near `packages/server/src/__tests__/session-file-dedup.test.ts` — origin namespacing. Triple: two hosts each with a session at cwd `/Users/robson/Project/x` · both register with one dashboard · sessions stay distinct and each is attributable to its originating device. (test-plan #E15)
- [x] 12.16 New Windows-facing test modelled on `packages/server/src/__tests__/ws-ticket.test.ts` — loopback pin. Triple: `--host 0.0.0.0` on Windows · start the bridge listener · listener bound to `127.0.0.1` only. (test-plan #E16)
- [x] 12.17 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/pi-gateway-consume-pending-attach.test.ts` — socket ownership. Triple: bound gateway socket · stat socket and dir · socket `0600`, dir `0700`. (test-plan #E18)
- [x] 12.18 Extend `packages/extension/src/__tests__/connection.test.ts` — `ws+unix` client dial regression. Triple: `ConnectionManager` constructed per this change · dial `ws+unix://<path>:/` · connection opens; a build that falls back to `globalThis.WebSocket` fails this test. (test-plan #E19)
- [x] 12.19 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/bridge-contention.test.ts` — provisional TTL boundary. Triple: provisional registration opened · commit at 29s and at 31s · 29s accepted, 31s refused because the provisional was already discarded. (test-plan #E20)
- [x] 12.20 New sibling test near `packages/server/src/__tests__/session-file-dedup.test.ts` — registration precedes transfer completion. Triple: remote join with a 44 MB transcript pending · observe timestamps · register-ack strictly precedes transfer-complete. (test-plan #P1)
- [x] 12.21 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/pi-gateway-consume-pending-attach.test.ts`, timed — socket transport parity. Triple: 1000 messages through the send ring over UDS vs TCP · compare p95 · UDS p95 not worse than TCP p95 by more than 20%. (test-plan #P4)
- [x] 12.22 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/pi-gateway-consume-pending-attach.test.ts` — a live socket is never unlinked. Triple: socket path already bound by a live listener · a second instance starts · startup aborts with a conflict naming the path, the incumbent stays bound, its bridges undisturbed. (test-plan #X1)
- [x] 12.23 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/pi-gateway-consume-pending-attach.test.ts` — concurrent bind is serialized. Triple: two instances race to bind one path · simultaneous start · exactly one binds, the other aborts with a conflict, and no live socket file is removed. (test-plan #X2)
- [x] 12.24 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/pi-gateway-consume-pending-attach.test.ts` — indeterminate probe fails closed. Triple: live listener with a saturated backlog returning `ECONNREFUSED` · probe before unlink · path NOT removed and startup aborts. (test-plan #X3)
- [x] 12.25 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — takeover is acquire-then-verify. Triple: two starters both observe the same dead holder · simultaneous takeover · exactly one owner results and neither deletes the other's live lock or fresh record. (test-plan #X4)
- [x] 12.26 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/bridge-contention.test.ts` — move refusal spares the origin. Triple: target refuses the provisional registration on the different-pid branch · attempt the move · origin stays registered and serving, and its `intentionalClose` is never set. (test-plan #X7)
- [x] 12.27 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/bridge-contention.test.ts` — commit never arrives. Triple: target accepts the provisional then goes silent · wait past 30s · provisional discarded, origin never stopped owning the send ring, no message lost or duplicated. (test-plan #X8)
- [x] 12.28 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/bridge-contention.test.ts` — provisional does not claim routing. Triple: live bridge on session A plus a provisional registration for A · provisional registers · `connections.get(A)` still maps to the origin socket and the origin's sends are still delivered. (test-plan #X9)
- [x] 12.29 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/bridge-contention.test.ts` — provisional is not an enumeration oracle. Triple: provisional registrations for one existing and one non-existent sessionId · compare the refusals · responses indistinguishable to the caller, or ownership proof required before either answers. (test-plan #X10)
- [x] 12.30 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/ws-ticket.test.ts` — revoked device is locked out. Triple: paired bridge device revoked · attempt ticket mint and register · both refused with a distinct reason. (test-plan #X11)
- [x] 12.31 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/identity.test.ts` — impostor at the expected address. Triple: server at the pinned address cannot answer the nonce challenge · remote bridge connects · registration refused with a fingerprint-mismatch reason. (test-plan #X12)
- [x] 12.32 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/ws-ticket.test.ts` — ticket misuse table. Triple: tickets that are reused, expired, or wrong-scope · present on upgrade · each refused with the three reasons distinguishable in logs. (test-plan #X13)
- [x] 12.33 New local-token test modelled on `packages/server/src/__tests__/ws-ticket.test.ts` — tokenless loopback. Triple: Windows bridge connects with no `X-Pi-Local-Token` · upgrade · refused, distinctly from a wrong-token refusal. (test-plan #X14)
- [x] 12.34 Extend the same new local-token test — wrong token. Triple: Windows bridge presents an incorrect token · upgrade · refused with a reason distinguishable from "missing". (test-plan #X15)
- [x] 12.35 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/home-lock.test.ts` — stale record, foreign listener. Triple: record names a port now held by an unrelated process · bridge dials it · refused with an identity mismatch rather than a generic connection failure, and a valid local token does not bypass it. (test-plan #X16)
- [x] 12.36 New sibling test near `packages/server/src/__tests__/session-file-dedup.test.ts` — transfer interrupted mid-flight. Triple: bridge dies during transcript transfer · inspect the stored transcript · partial data is not presented as complete and the gap is detectable. (test-plan #X18)
- [x] 12.37 New sibling test near `packages/server/src/__tests__/session-file-dedup.test.ts` — resume refused for an ended remote session. Triple: remote session whose bridge has ended · `POST /api/session/:id/resume` · refused with an explanation naming host unreachability, while a local session is unaffected. (test-plan #X19)
- [x] 12.38 Extend `packages/server/src/__tests__/bridge-contention.test.ts` — unauthenticated gateway registration. Triple: unauthenticated peer on the TCP gateway · attempt `session_register` for an arbitrary sessionId · refused, inverting the hole this change closes. (test-plan #X20)

### L2 — qa VM smoke, `qa/tests/*.sh` | `*.ps1` (no rendered-UI asserts)

- [x] 12.39 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — POSIX binds no bridge TCP port. Triple: default `pi-dashboard` start on macOS/Linux · inspect listening sockets · no TCP listener on the gateway port at all. (test-plan #E17)
- [x] 12.40 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — registration not blocked, wall clock. Triple: remote join with a 44 MB transcript · measure over 20 runs · prompt accepted within 1s of register-ack at p95. (test-plan #P2)
- [x] 12.41 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — remote-join at p99 transcript size. Triple: remote join with a ~4 MB transcript · 20 runs · register-to-usable p95 recorded as a baseline. (test-plan #P3)
- [x] 12.42 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — promotion poll churn soak. Triple: 3 attach-mode instances with a 60s poll and the owner alive throughout · run 10 minutes · zero spurious promotions and lock acquisitions bounded by poll count. (test-plan #P5)
- [x] 12.43 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — `where` reports endpoint/identity/pinned. Triple: bridge registered with an instance · run `/dashboard where` · prints current endpoint, instance id, and pinned status. (test-plan #F7)
  - Writing this arm found the command short of task 9.6: `instance:` read `unverified` for every session the dashboard spawns, because those are pinned via `PI_DASHBOARD_SOCKET` and only the record-sourced path carried an id. Fixed at the source the socket itself names — `instances/<piPort>.id`, the sibling of `gateway-<piPort>.sock`. The record could NOT be used: it names the HOME's owner, so a session pinned to an attach instance's socket would have been told a confident wrong id.
- [x] 12.44 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — crashed owner is recovered. Triple: record owner killed with SIGKILL while one attach instance is alive · wait · survivor promotes within 60s and an unpinned bridge then resolves to the survivor, not the dead endpoint. (test-plan #X5)
- [x] 12.45 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — clean shutdown keeps a default. Triple: owner stops cleanly while one attach instance is alive · shutdown completes · survivor promotes and the HOME still has a resolvable default. (test-plan #X6)
- [x] 12.46 New arm modelled on `qa/tests/03-websocket.sh` — filesystem without UDS support. Triple: HOME on a filesystem where socket bind fails · start dashboard · falls back to loopback + token, the log names the actual cause, and it never falls back to discovery. (test-plan #X17)

### L3 — Playwright e2e, `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` (harness port from `.pi-test-harness.json`, never hardcoded)

- [x] 12.47 New spec modelled on `tests/e2e/bridge-contention-health.spec.ts` — move renders as moved. Triple: session live on the origin dashboard · complete a move to the target · origin card converges to *moved*, never *crashed* or dead. (test-plan #F1)
- [x] 12.48 New spec modelled on `tests/e2e/blackhole-settings.spec.ts` — gateway transport surfaced. Triple: dashboard running on a UDS listener · open settings · gateway endpoint displayed and not blank, guarding `address()` returning a string for UDS. (test-plan #F2)
- [x] 12.49 New spec modelled on `tests/e2e/ended-session-endedat.spec.ts` — ended remote session hides resume. Triple: remote session whose bridge has ended · view the session · resume is not presented as an available action. (test-plan #F3)
- [x] 12.50 New spec modelled on `tests/e2e/bridge-contention-health.spec.ts` — origin converges without reload. Triple: origin dashboard open in a browser · move completes · origin view reaches *moved* with no manual reload. (test-plan #F4)
- [x] 12.51 New spec modelled on `tests/e2e/session-context-injection.spec.ts` — session origin displayed. Triple: session originating on another host · view the session list · originating device shown. (test-plan #F5)
- [x] 12.52 **NOT WRITABLE against what shipped — deferred with the read path.** New spec modelled on `tests/e2e/large-session-replay.spec.ts` — pre-attach history renders. Triple: remote session with entries predating the bridge attach · open the transcript · pre-attach entries present in the rendered transcript. (test-plan #F6)
  - Moved to `serve-retained-remote-transcripts` with the read path it needs. `RemoteTranscriptStore.read()` still has no caller and no route, so this spec had nothing to drive; the follow-up carries both the route and this scenario.
  - The requirement this scenario tests was narrowed to acquisition-and-retention: `RemoteTranscriptStore` is written by the `transcript_chunk` handler and its `read()` has NO caller, no HTTP route, and no client surface. There is therefore no rendered transcript for a browser test to assert on, and any spec written today would either test the store directly (not L3) or pass vacuously. Moves with the read path into the follow-up carved out in `proposal.md`.

> Tasks 12.47–12.51 landed as one file, `tests/e2e/gateway-origin-surfaces.spec.ts`, rather than five: all five need the same paired-bridge registration, the same ended-tier reveal, and the same harness plumbing, and five copies of it would drift apart. Each test names its task and its test-plan id.

### Manual-only (no test folded; deferred post-merge)

- [x] 12.53 Windows credential readability on a real Windows host: log in as a second standard OS user and attempt to read `~/.pi/dashboard/local/token`, `identity.key`, and `paired-devices.json`. `chmod` is a documented no-op on Windows, so this rests on inherited NTFS ACLs and must be observed rather than asserted. (test-plan: manual-only)
  - Moved to `verify-windows-credential-acls` (test-plan M1, manual-only). Needs a real Windows host from the `qa/` VM matrix.
  - **Downgraded from manual-only to CI-observable, pending evidence.** A hosted `windows-latest` runner has admin, so §4 of the Windows arm creates a STANDARD local user (hard-failing if it lands in Administrators, which would make the test vacuous) and attempts the read. If impersonation proves infeasible on a hosted runner, the arm says so instead of passing, and this task stays open for a real host.

## 13. Verification

- [x] 13.1 Full test suite green
  - 16064 passed / 35 skipped locally after merging `origin/develop`, and `ci.yml` green on the PR.
  - Worth recording WHY this needed saying twice: PR #534 had been `CONFLICTING` with develop, and GitHub cannot build a merge commit for a conflicted PR — so NO `pull_request` workflow had run on it for days. Only CodeQL (which runs on the head ref) reported, and its green badge made the PR look checked. The merge is what let CI, and this change's new cross-platform workflow, run at all.
- [x] 13.2 Isolated-verification run: two dashboards under two HOMEs, each with its own bridges, no cross-talk, without needing `PI_DASHBOARD_NO_MDNS`
- [x] 13.3 Reproduce the hijack scenario — a stale dashboard advertising a hostname it does not serve — and confirm a bridge on the socket path is unaffected
- [x] 13.4 Move a live session between two same-HOME instances and confirm no prompt is lost, history still resolves, and the origin shows *moved*
- [x] 13.5 Remote-join end-to-end: local pi pairs with a remote dashboard, registers, survives a reconnect, ~~serves history predating the attach~~, retains that history after the session ends, and is locked out after revocation
  - **One clause struck, not ticked.** "Serves history predating the attach" is the READ path, deferred with §11 (see proposal.md and 12.52): `RemoteTranscriptStore.read()` has no caller and no route, so nothing can serve it. Verifying the rest and quietly counting that one would make this line a false claim.
  - Pairs + registers: exercised for real by `tests/e2e/gateway-origin-surfaces.spec.ts` — host-run specs reach the gateway across the docker bridge, so they pair (`/api/pair/payload` → redeem → approve), mint a single-use bridge ticket, and register as a genuinely REMOTE peer. F5 then reads the origin back off the card.
  - Survives a reconnect: `connection.ts` backoff + `connection.test.ts`; transport-agnostic, and 3.8's fix in this change is what stops a health blip from making the close terminal.
  - Retains after the session ends: acquisition is wired and exercised end-to-end by `qa/tests/25-gateway-remote-join-perf.sh`, which streams `transcript_chunk` frames straight after `session_register`; the store's own retention-past-end behaviour is `remote-transcript-store.test.ts` (task 11.10). Retention is write-only by design here.
  - Locked out after revocation: `bridge-ticket-eligibility.test.ts` — a revoked bearer is refused at mint, so it never reaches an upgrade.
- [x] 13.6 Confirm an ended remote session refuses resume with an explanation, and a local session does not
  - Confirming it found the gate was on the wrong door. `POST /api/session/:id/resume` refused correctly, but the dashboard client does not use REST — it sends `resume_session` over the BUS, and that handler never called `decideResume`. The only thing between a drag-to-resume and a local pi writing a foreign transcript was the client hiding a button (12.49). Hiding is not refusing: drag-to-resume, an automation, or any bus client bypasses it.
  - Now gated in `handleResumeSession` too, placed BEFORE the `sessionFile` guard like its REST twin — the dangerous case is a present, plausible path belonging to another host (#E15), not a missing one.
  - Explanation reaches the user: the server's reason names the device and distinguishes ended ("no longer connected") from live ("a second pi writing the same transcript"); `SessionList.tsx` renders it as `Resume failed: …`. Delivered to the socket that ASKED, so a browser that did not initiate correctly sees nothing.
  - Evidence: `resume-remote-origin-bus.test.ts` (4 cases incl. a local control arm that must NOT be refused) and F7 in `gateway-origin-surfaces.spec.ts`, which fires the message the hidden button would have sent and asserts the refusal on the bus.
- [x] 13.7 Measure the remote-join path against a p99 transcript (~4 MB) and the observed maximum (~44 MB); record registration latency and transfer cost
- [x] 13.8 Cross-platform QA arms for macOS, Linux, and Windows, including that a POSIX default start binds no bridge TCP port at all
  - **All three legs green** (`ci-gateway-platform.yml` run 32683154560). ubuntu + macOS: `/api/health` advertises a `gateway-*.sock`, `lsof` AND a connect probe agree nothing listens on the gateway port, and a bridge still registers over the socket — so the absence is privacy, not breakage. Windows: the inverted expectation, above.
  - Teeth without a code mutation: `PI_GATEWAY_TCP=1` turns the POSIX arm red.
  - `.github/workflows/ci-gateway-platform.yml` runs both: ubuntu+macOS for the POSIX arm, `windows-latest` for the Windows one. Deliberately not in `ci.yml`, which is a cheap single-runner PR net.
- [x] 13.9 Update `docs/architecture.md` via DocScribe (transport, precedence ladder, auth model, move command, remote transcript access + the read-only boundary)
