# Tasks — unify-pi-runtime-identity

## 1. Version-gate groundwork (shared)

- [x] 1.1 Hoist the canonical floor into `packages/shared/src/node-version.ts`: add the
      `MIN_SUPPORTED_NODE` constant and `meetsFloor(version, floor)` comparator, refactor the
      inline arithmetic to stay lockstep-asserted (unit test asserting constant ⇄ predicate
      agreement), and fix the accept-set doc comment to include 23.x. Verify: new unit tests pass
      and the `node-cap-message-matches-engines` lint stays green.
- [x] 1.2 Implement `readPiEnginesFloor()`: walk up from the resolved pi entry to the nearest
      matching `package.json`, parse `engines.node` shapes (`>=X.Y.Z` ± cap, `^X`, `~X.Y`),
      fallback to `MIN_SUPPORTED_NODE` on anything else. Verify: unit tests cover each shape and
      the fallback.

## 2. Spawn-runtime resolver

- [x] 2.1 Export the login-shell resolver from `packages/shared/src/platform/binary-lookup.ts`
      (currently private `whichViaLoginShell`) without behaviour change. Verify: existing
      binary-lookup tests still pass plus a new export test.
- [x] 2.2 Provide `classifyNodeSource` per design D4: import from `manage-node-runtime-updates`'
      implementation if landed, else vendor under the identical signature with a convergence
      comment. Verify: unit tests for managed / system / bundled-electron classification.
- [x] 2.3 Implement `resolveSpawnRuntime()` in `packages/shared/src/platform/spawn-runtime.ts`:
      step-1 override read (`runtime.override`, then the `tool-overrides.json` `node` key),
      arm-dependent step-2 candidate order (login-shell first on GUI/service launches, `PATH`
      first on terminal-launched arms and Windows, then version-manager-default fs probe),
      gated step 3 (managed), step-4 terminal rung (bundled / `execPath`), fixed-argv
      version+ABI candidate probe, and a recorded-reason resolution trail. Verify: unit tests
      enumerate the completeness-matrix cells with injected probes.
- [x] 2.4 Implement spawn-time re-validation: identity signature (lstat + realpath + mtime) with
      probe-on-drift for concrete/symlink paths, per-spawn probe for shim-shaped paths
      (volta/asdf/fnm/mise dirs). Verify: unit tests cover retargeted symlink and shim cases.

## 3. Application points

- [x] 3.1 Replace `prependManagedNodeToPath` at the pi-session spawn path
      (`packages/server/src/spawn-process/process-manager.ts:240`) with env construction from the
      resolved runtime (resolved bin dir first on `PATH`, no global `process.env` mutation),
      leaving `pi-core-updater`'s managed-tree prepend in place. Verify: unit tests for env
      construction; pi-core-updater tests unchanged.
- [x] 3.2 Point explicit node-binary argv spawns (Windows headless pairing) at the resolved
      binary. Verify: argv-assembly unit test receives the resolved path.
- [x] 3.3 Route dashboard-performed shared-tree mutations (recommended-extension installs, Part-2
      rebuilds) through the resolved family using per-member entries (`nodeEntry`/`npmEntry`,
      bundled npm via `bundled-node.ts`). Verify: unit tests assert the constructed install/rebuild
      command uses the resolved family's entries.

## 4. Publication

- [x] 4.1 Publish `runtime.resolved` on successful startup via atomic temp-write + rename that
      preserves unknown keys and round-trips `runtime.override` byte-identical; bundled runtime
      publishes path-free (`{source, abi, resolvedAt, ephemeral?}`) with `/tmp/.mount_*` and
      `/AppTranslocation/` marked ephemeral. Verify: unit tests for each publication shape and the
      override round-trip.
- [x] 4.2 Add the `pi-dashboard runtime` CLI print of the published block plus live resolution.
      Verify: CLI test asserts output includes binary, version, ABI, and source.

## 5. ABI guard rail

- [x] 5.1 Implement `readNativeModuleAbi` two-tier: best-effort file inspection, authoritative
      out-of-process load probe (child `process.dlopen`, parse the `NODE_MODULE_VERSION X …
      requires Y` shape), plus the N-API classifier (symbol inspection, never distribution
      layout). Verify: unit tests with fake probe outputs; classifier test distinguishes a
      V8-bound prebuild layout from an N-API module.
- [x] 5.2 Implement the discovery walk + manifest: depth-capped walk finding nested `.node` files
      (`build/Release/**`, `prebuilds/**`), entries carrying stat signature + `builtAbi`/N-API
      marker. Verify: unit test against a fixture tree with nested modules.
- [x] 5.3 Implement the pre-spawn manifest re-stat check with in-place-rebuild invalidation.
      Verify: unit test rewrites a fixture `.node` (same tree shape) and observes re-evaluation.
- [x] 5.4 Add Doctor ABI-mismatch rows (module, built ABI, resolved runtime + ABI, scoped rebuild
      command), the offered reconciliation flow, and `runtime.autoRebuild` with
      divergence-abstention. Verify: doctor-core unit tests cover mismatch row content, consent
      default, autoRebuild run, and abstention.

## 6. Doctor visibility + home-directory contract

- [x] 6.1 Add the resolved-runtime visibility row: resolved binary/version/ABI/source beside
      every probe-discovered installation, shadowed-selection naming, `node -v` compare remedy,
      above-cap informational note. Verify: doctor-core unit tests.
- [x] 6.2 Rework `detectLegacyManagedDir()` to the orphan test (no `node/`, no wizard state, no
      non-empty `node_modules/`, no `doctor.log`/`server.log`) and make the Doctor row and
      `cli.ts` startup advisory follow it; live content names its consumers, never suggests
      deletion. Verify: unit tests enumerate the live-content combinations.
- [x] 6.3 Make `buildEnginesRangeMessage` include the managed-Node PATH hint only when
      `<managedDir>/node/` exists; update its test and the `no-managed-dir-reference` allowlist
      rationale. Verify: guard unit tests for both machine states.
- [x] 6.4 Docs drift pass (DocScribe for `docs/` prose): README.md:120,126 floor text,
      `docs/architecture.md` retired range + stale `node-version-check.ts`/`isKnownBadNode`
      reference, `known-issues.md:26-29` pre-widening values, ownership split
      (`~/.pi/dashboard/` vs `~/.pi-dashboard/`). Verify: `kb dox lint` clean and greps for the
      stale strings return nothing.

## 7. Upstream escape hatches (report, don't own)

- [x] 7.1 File the `pi-hermes-memory` issue: prefer builtin `node:sqlite` with better-sqlite3
      fallback. Verify: issue link recorded in this change's notes. (Draft + target recorded in
      notes.md; user declined autonomous filing on the third-party repo, 2026-08-30.)
- [x] 7.2 File the pi issue: shared extension tree has no owning runtime; per-ABI segregation of
      `.node` artifacts. Verify: issue link recorded in this change's notes. (Draft + target
      recorded in notes.md; user declined autonomous filing on the third-party repo, 2026-08-30.)

## 8. Coordination

- [x] 8.1 Confirm the `add-node-runtime-family-selection` coordination note still matches the
      landed ladder behaviour (selection = gated step-1 candidate; supersession contract), and
      update the archive-order note if that change has progressed. Verify: both proposals'
      coordination text agree.
