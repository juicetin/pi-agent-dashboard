## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Core package discovery
The server SHALL discover all installed pi ecosystem core packages from both global npm and the managed install directory (`~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/`) using a strict whitelist of package names. The `pi-*` name-prefix heuristic SHALL NOT be used.

The whitelist consists of:
- `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
- `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`
- `@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard`
- `@blackbelt-technology/pi-model-proxy`

#### Scenario: Global npm packages discovered
- **WHEN** the server runs `npm list -g --depth=0 --json`
- **THEN** it SHALL parse the output and identify pi ecosystem packages by matching ONLY the whitelist above
- **AND** each discovered package SHALL include its installed version from the JSON output

#### Scenario: Non-whitelisted pi-prefixed package ignored
- **WHEN** `npm list -g` includes a package whose name starts with `pi-` (e.g., `pi-agent-browser`, `pi-web-access`) but is NOT in the whitelist
- **THEN** the package SHALL NOT appear in the core discovery result
- **AND** SHALL NOT appear in `GET /api/pi-core/status`

#### Scenario: Managed install packages discovered
- **WHEN** the directory `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` exists
- **THEN** the server SHALL scan it ONLY for packages matching the whitelist by reading each matching `package.json`
- **AND** mark their `installSource` as `"managed"`

#### Scenario: Managed directory does not exist
- **WHEN** `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` does not exist
- **THEN** the server SHALL skip managed scanning without error
- **AND** only return globally installed whitelisted packages

#### Scenario: npm list command fails
- **WHEN** `npm list -g --depth=0 --json` fails or times out (30s)
- **THEN** the server SHALL log a warning and return an empty list for global packages

#### Scenario: Duplicate package in both sources
- **WHEN** a whitelisted package is found in both global npm and managed install
- **THEN** the managed install version SHALL take precedence
