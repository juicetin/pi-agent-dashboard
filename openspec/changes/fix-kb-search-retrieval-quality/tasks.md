## 1. Measurement baseline (land first — no behaviour change)

- [ ] 1.1 Add `distinctSourcesAtK`, `duplicateSlotShare`, and `singleSourcePageRate` to `EvalMetrics` in `packages/kb/src/eval.ts`; compute them over the same top-K window as the ranking metrics
- [ ] 1.2 Write failing tests for the three redundancy metrics (all-distinct page → share 0; all-one-source page → share (K-1)/K and singleSourcePageRate 1)
- [ ] 1.3 Add the markdown-intent golden fixture (101 `query → expected path` pairs) under `packages/kb/src/__tests__/fixtures/`
- [ ] 1.4 Add the source-intent golden fixture (84 pairs whose targets are source files reached via their `AGENTS.md` record)
- [ ] 1.5 Write a fixture provenance header documenting derivation from implicit click feedback in session transcripts and the known bias toward searches that produced an opened file
- [ ] 1.6 Record the pre-change baseline for both fixtures (P@1, P@5, Recall@K, MRR, nDCG@K, redundancy metrics) in the change folder as the regression reference

## 2. Source-level dedup and result limit (D1, D2, D6)

- [ ] 2.1 Write failing tests: one hit per `(root, path)`; representative is the best-scoring chunk; suppressed count reported; zero when a source matches once
- [ ] 2.2 Write a failing test that source dedup runs AFTER exact-content dedup, so cross-root duplicates still populate `akaPaths`
- [ ] 2.3 Add `suppressedSections` (or equivalent) to `KbHit` in `packages/kb/src/types.ts`
- [ ] 2.4 Implement source-level dedup in `SqliteFtsStore.search()`, ordered body-hash collapse → source dedup
- [ ] 2.5 Add a `sourceDedup` config flag (default on) and honour it in `SearchOpts`
- [ ] 2.6 Change the candidate fetch to scale with `limit` (multiple of `limit`, bounded by the existing 4000 ceiling); write a test asserting the pool exceeds `limit`
- [ ] 2.7 Write a latency test asserting a default search over the fixture index completes within the 50 ms budget
- [ ] 2.8 Re-run both fixtures; confirm Recall@K rises and duplicate-slot share falls versus the 1.6 baseline

## 3. Condensed render (D5)

- [ ] 3.1 Write failing tests for `renderHits`: leaf heading only, no full breadcrumb, suppressed-section marker present when count > 0 and absent when 0
- [ ] 3.2 Implement the leaf-heading + `(+N more sections)` render in `packages/kb/src/render.ts`, keeping the CLI and tool forms parameterised as today
- [ ] 3.3 Keep `headingPath` intact in the JSON format and in `KbHit` so `kb_get(path, section)` addressing still works; test both formats
- [ ] 3.4 Measure rendered page size across the fixture queries and assert it does not exceed the pre-change mean

## 4. Document-type lane quota (D3)

- [ ] 4.1 Write failing tests: agents hits appear without a `docType` filter; explicit `docType` bypasses the quota; a starved lane yields its slots; share of zero disables the quota
- [ ] 4.2 Add the lane-share config field (`ranking.laneQuota` or equivalent) with the measured 6/4 default, documented as untuned
- [ ] 4.3 Implement two-lane retrieval and interleave in `search()`
- [ ] 4.4 Re-run both fixtures; confirm the source-intent set improves and the markdown-intent set does not regress beyond the recorded loss budget
- [ ] 4.5 Sweep the lane share over the fixtures and record the curve; keep or revise the default based on the result

## 5. PRF expansion and coverage rerank (D4 — must land after 4)

- [ ] 5.1 Write failing tests for coverage rerank: broader IDF-weighted coverage outranks concentrated repetition; BM25 breaks ties; disabling restores BM25 order
- [ ] 5.2 Implement IDF-weighted coverage reranking over the candidate pool
- [ ] 5.3 Write failing tests for PRF: feedback terms are mined from a first pass, exclude query terms, exclude terms above the corpus-frequency ceiling, and are bounded in count
- [ ] 5.4 Implement PRF inside `expandQuery`, replacing the pass-through stub and its stale "handled by callers" comment
- [ ] 5.5 Write a failing test that PRF is skipped when coverage rerank is disabled
- [ ] 5.6 Make coverage rerank weight the ORIGINAL query terms above appended terms; test that expansion cannot dominate the sort
- [ ] 5.7 Change the `queryExpansion` default to `prf` in `packages/kb/src/config.ts`
- [ ] 5.8 Re-run both fixtures; confirm the combined stack beats the 1.6 baseline on Recall@K and MRR with no rise in duplicate-slot share
- [ ] 5.9 Validate the per-source cap on a held-out slice of the fixtures, since it was derived by inspecting losses

## 6. `kb_get` truncation (D7 — independent)

- [ ] 6.1 Write a failing test: a path-only fetch against a multi-chunk file must not return a single section with no indication others exist
- [ ] 6.2 Implement the non-silent path-only fetch in `getChunk`
- [ ] 6.3 Surface the behaviour in the `kb_get` tool and the `kb get` CLI; update the tool description

## 7. `dox lint` source-file coverage (D9 — independent)

- [ ] 7.1 Write failing tests: an undocumented source file in a covered directory reports `missing`; a file with a `<file>.AGENTS.md` sidecar does not; declaration/test/spec files and excluded trees never report
- [ ] 7.2 Implement the source-file arm as a set difference over `sourceFiles()` and `parseRowPaths()` in `packages/kb/src/dox.ts`
- [ ] 7.3 Make the arm independently enableable so an existing tree can adopt it incrementally
- [ ] 7.4 Run it over this repo, record the finding count, and confirm it does not red-wall CI by default

## 8. Tool contract and consumers (BREAKING)

- [ ] 8.1 Update the `kb_search` tool description: leaf-heading shape, suppressed-section marker, `limit` bounds distinct sources; remove the "prefer 2–5 terms" advice the ranking does not reward
- [ ] 8.2 Audit `kb-plugin` and the `kb search` CLI for assumptions that `limit` counts chunks; fix any found
- [ ] 8.3 Update `packages/kb/src/AGENTS.md`, `packages/kb-extension/src/AGENTS.md`, and the affected sidecars with purpose rows and `See change:` markers
- [ ] 8.4 Delegate a DocScribe pass for `docs/architecture.md` (retrieval pipeline: lanes, dedup order, expansion) in caveman style

## 9. Discipline gates

- [ ] 9.1 `doubt-driven-review` on the `limit` semantics change and the condensed output shape before they stand
- [ ] 9.2 `performance-optimization` on the fetch-depth change: measure, state the budget, confirm the 50 ms assertion holds on the real index
- [ ] 9.3 `review-code` over the full diff across store, render, eval, dox, and extension
- [ ] 9.4 `npm run quality:changed` clean

## 10. Verification

- [ ] 10.1 `set -o pipefail; npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pi-test.log` green
- [ ] 10.2 Both fixtures beat the 1.6 baseline on Recall@K, MRR, and duplicate-slot share; record the final table in the change folder
- [ ] 10.3 Manual: run three real queries from the fixtures through the live tool and read the rendered pages — confirm no page is dominated by one source
- [ ] 10.4 Restart the dashboard (`curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/restart`) and confirm `kb_search` behaves as specified in a live session
- [ ] 10.5 Open a follow-up note on the deferred items: query-refinement hints, and the un-measured fall-through rate. Do NOT repoint `scripts/ab-context` at mined real queries — tested 2026-08-06, no effect (p=1.0); the gap is cold-single-turn vs warm-multi-turn, so the harness needs multi-turn warm-context fixtures or must be accepted as unable to gate this change (see ab-context-calibration.md)
