# Tasks — steer agents to kb tools

## 1. Root AGENTS.md gate
- [ ] 1.1 Replace the prose "STOP — Docs-First Gate" READ portion with the
      substitution table (design.md canonical form), naming the symbol-lookup
      case and adding `kb_neighbors` / `kb_get` rows.
- [ ] 1.2 Keep one short imperative for the how-to/build path (`grep docs/faq.md`
      first); drop the rest of the "STOP / you violated" scare framing.
- [ ] 1.3 Keep the explicit fall-through + WRITE-discipline loopback (grep on tree
      miss → add the missing row).
- [ ] 1.4 Verify byte size did not balloon (AGENTS.md loads every turn) — table
      should be net-neutral or smaller than the prose it replaces.

## 2. project-init seeded READ discipline (dox-doctrine.md)
- [ ] 2.1 Add the substitution table to the `<!-- dox:read:kb -->` block
      (`kb agents` / `kb_search`).
- [ ] 2.2 Add a degraded same-shape table to the `<!-- dox:read:manual -->` block
      (walk directory `AGENTS.md` chain; no `kb_search`).
- [ ] 2.3 Preserve the delimiter markers so the seeder still composes the block.

## 3. Coding profile template
- [ ] 3.1 In `profiles/coding/AGENTS.md.tmpl`, change "Never speculate about code
      you have not opened. Read the file first." → "…consult the doc tree
      (`kb agents <path>` / `kb_search`) first, then read the specific file."
- [ ] 3.2 Add a one-line pointer to the seeded READ discipline.

## 4. Review & validate
- [ ] 4.1 `openspec validate steer-agents-to-kb-tools --strict`.
- [ ] 4.2 `doubt-driven-review` pass: confirm the table cannot be read as "kb
      replaces all grep"; fall-through stays explicit.
- [ ] 4.3 Grep the three edited files to confirm no remaining "read the file
      first" anti-pattern and no orphaned "STOP/violation" prose.

## 5. Manual verification (tested later)
- [ ] 5.1 Scaffold a throwaway project via `project-init` (coding, dox-wired);
      confirm the seeded root `AGENTS.md` contains the kb substitution table.
- [ ] 5.2 Scaffold the manual variant; confirm the degraded table is seeded.
