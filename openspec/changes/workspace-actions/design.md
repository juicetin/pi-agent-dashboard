## Context

The process manager (`src/server/process-manager.ts`) already implements `spawnPiSession(cwd)` via tmux but has no REST endpoint. The sidebar group headers show editor buttons but no action buttons for spawning sessions or creating worktrees. Git worktree creation needs a server endpoint that runs `git worktree add`.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Expose spawn-session as a REST endpoint
- Add "Add pi-agent" button on group headers
- Add "Add worktree" button on group headers with a dialog for branch name
- Create `POST /api/git/worktree` endpoint

**Non-Goals:**
- Worktree detection/display (handled by worktree-awareness change)
- Filesystem browsing for workspace creation (handled by filesystem-browser change)
- Worktree deletion or management beyond creation

## Decisions

### 1. Spawn session endpoint
**Decision**: Add `POST /api/spawn-session` accepting `{ cwd: string }`. Localhost-only. Calls existing `spawnPiSession(cwd)`. Returns `{ success, message }`.

**Rationale**: Reuses existing process manager. Simple REST wrapper. Validates CWD exists on disk (not necessarily a known session — user may want to spawn in an empty workspace).

### 2. Git worktree endpoint
**Decision**: Add `POST /api/git/worktree` accepting `{ cwd: string, branchName: string, worktreePath?: string }`. Localhost-only. Runs `git worktree add -b <branchName> <worktreePath> <baseBranch>` where `baseBranch` is detected from the CWD's current branch. If `worktreePath` is omitted, derive it as `<parent-of-cwd>/<cwd-basename>-<branchName>`.

**Rationale**: Auto-deriving the worktree path as a sibling directory is the most common pattern. The base branch is the CWD's current branch, which matches the user's expectation of "branch off from here."

### 3. Action buttons placement
**Decision**: Add icon buttons to the group header action area (alongside existing editor buttons): a `+` pi icon for "Add pi-agent" and a `⎇+` icon for "Add worktree". Both are localhost-only (hidden on remote access like editor buttons).

**Rationale**: Keeps all group-level actions in one row. Consistent with existing editor button pattern.

### 4. Add worktree dialog
**Decision**: Simple modal dialog with:
- Branch name input (required)
- Auto-derived worktree path (editable, shown as preview)
- Base branch display (read-only, from group's detected branch)
- Create / Cancel buttons

**Rationale**: Minimal UI. Most users only need to type the branch name; the path is auto-derived.

### 5. Client API functions
**Decision**: Add `spawnSession(cwd)` and `createWorktree(cwd, branchName, worktreePath?)` to a new `src/client/lib/workspace-api.ts` module following the same pattern as `editor-api.ts`.

**Rationale**: DRY — consistent API helper pattern across the client.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **[Git worktree errors]** → If the branch already exists or the path is taken, git will fail. Mitigation: return the git error message in the API response and show in the dialog.
- **[tmux not available]** → Spawn will fail on systems without tmux. Mitigation: existing process-manager already returns a clear error message; show it as toast.
- **[CWD validation]** → Spawn endpoint validates path exists on disk but doesn't require it to be a known session CWD. Mitigation: acceptable — users should be able to spawn into workspace folders that have no sessions yet.
