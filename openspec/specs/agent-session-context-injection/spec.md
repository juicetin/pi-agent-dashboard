# agent-session-context-injection Specification

## Purpose
Bridge injects a per-turn fragment into the agent's system prompt naming the active pi session (`sessionId`, `cwd`) and, when set, the dashboard-attached OpenSpec change with the path to its artifacts. Closes the gap where the agent had no structured awareness of its own session or the attached change.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Bridge injects per-turn dashboard session context into system prompt

The bridge extension SHALL register a `pi.on("before_agent_start", ...)` handler that returns `{ systemPrompt }` containing a splice-replaced copy of `event.systemPrompt` on every turn. The handler SHALL locate the LAST occurrence of the literal anchor `\nCurrent working directory: ` in `event.systemPrompt` and replace from that anchor through end-of-string with the dashboard-session-context fragment. The fragment carries `cwd` itself, so the dropped `Current working directory:` line loses no information. All `event.systemPrompt` content BEFORE the anchor SHALL be preserved verbatim, so the handler composes with pi's body and with other extensions' system-prompt contributions. When the anchor is absent, the handler SHALL fall back to appending the fragment after a single blank-line separator (`\n\n`).

The fragment SHALL be enclosed in clearly-marked delimiters so it is distinguishable from user content and from the rest of the system prompt. The opening delimiter SHALL be the literal line `── pi-dashboard session context ──`. The fragment SHALL NOT carry a trailing blank line; the caller controls separators (a leading `\n` on splice, `\n\n` on fallback append).

The fragment SHALL always include exactly one line of the form:

```
You are pi session `<sessionId>` running in `<cwd>`.
```

where `<sessionId>` is `bc.sessionId` (the bridge-owned dashboard session id; pi exposes no `pi.sessionId`) and `<cwd>` is `event.systemPromptOptions.cwd`.

When `BridgeContext.attachedChange` is a non-empty string, the fragment SHALL include exactly one additional line of the form:

```
Attached OpenSpec change: `<change-name>`. See `openspec/changes/<change-name>/{proposal,design,tasks}.md`.
```

When `BridgeContext.attachedChange` is `null`, `undefined`, or the empty string, the attached-change line SHALL be omitted entirely.

#### Scenario: No attached change — splices over trailing cwd line, only sessionId/cwd line included

- **WHEN** `before_agent_start` fires and `BridgeContext.attachedChange` is `null`
- **AND** `bc.sessionId === "abc-123"` and `event.systemPromptOptions.cwd === "/Users/robson/Project/pi-agent-dashboard"`
- **AND** `event.systemPrompt` ends with `"…Current date: 2026-06-27\nCurrent working directory: /Users/robson/Project/pi-agent-dashboard"`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL return `{ systemPrompt }` where everything up to and including `"…Current date: 2026-06-27"` is retained verbatim, the original `Current working directory:` line is dropped, and the result ends with `"\n── pi-dashboard session context ──\nYou are pi session `abc-123` running in `/Users/robson/Project/pi-agent-dashboard`."`
- **AND** no `Attached OpenSpec change:` line SHALL appear

#### Scenario: Attached change — both lines included

- **WHEN** `before_agent_start` fires and `BridgeContext.attachedChange === "wire-plugin-registry-into-shell"`
- **THEN** the spliced-in fragment SHALL contain the `You are pi session` line followed by `Attached OpenSpec change: \`wire-plugin-registry-into-shell\`. See \`openspec/changes/wire-plugin-registry-into-shell/{proposal,design,tasks}.md\`.`

#### Scenario: Detach reflected on next turn — line removed silently

- **WHEN** turn N fires with `BridgeContext.attachedChange === "X"` (line included)
- **AND** before turn N+1 the server pushes `attach_proposal_changed { attachedChange: null }`
- **AND** the bridge updates `BridgeContext.attachedChange = null`
- **AND** turn N+1's `before_agent_start` fires
- **THEN** turn N+1's fragment SHALL omit the `Attached OpenSpec change:` line entirely
- **AND** no synthetic message SHALL be injected announcing the detach

#### Scenario: Splice preserves content before the anchor

- **WHEN** `event.systemPrompt` contains the anchor `\nCurrent working directory: ` and arbitrary content before it (pi's body plus any earlier extensions' contributions)
- **AND** the dashboard injector handler fires
- **THEN** the returned `systemPrompt` SHALL retain all content before the anchor verbatim
- **AND** everything from the anchor through end-of-string SHALL be replaced by the dashboard fragment

#### Scenario: Multiple anchors — only the last is replaced

- **WHEN** `event.systemPrompt` contains the anchor `\nCurrent working directory: ` more than once
- **THEN** the handler SHALL splice only at the LAST occurrence, leaving earlier occurrences untouched

#### Scenario: Fallback append when anchor absent

- **WHEN** `event.systemPrompt` does NOT contain the anchor `\nCurrent working directory: ` (future pi versions or third-party SP overrides)
- **AND** the dashboard injector handler fires
- **THEN** the returned `systemPrompt` SHALL equal the full prior `event.systemPrompt` followed by `\n\n` and the dashboard fragment

#### Scenario: Injection persists across session reseating on fork/resume

- **WHEN** pi reseats the session via fork or resume (same `pi` instance; `bridge.ts` updates the tracked `sessionId` in `session_start`)
- **THEN** the already-registered `before_agent_start` handler SHALL still fire on subsequent turns (no re-registration required)
- **AND** it SHALL build the fragment from the NEW session's `sessionId`/`attachedChange`, read live via the getter

### Requirement: BridgeContext carries attachedChange state

`BridgeContext` SHALL include a mutable field `attachedChange: string | null` (initial value `null`). The field SHALL be the single in-memory source of truth read by the `before_agent_start` handler.

#### Scenario: Initial state on bridge construction

- **WHEN** a bridge `BridgeContext` is constructed via `createBridgeContext`
- **THEN** `bc.attachedChange === null`

#### Scenario: Updated by inbound `attach_proposal_changed`

- **WHEN** the bridge's connection layer receives `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId: <bc.sessionId>, attachedChange: "X" }`
- **THEN** `bc.attachedChange === "X"`

#### Scenario: Cleared by `attach_proposal_changed` with null

- **WHEN** `bc.attachedChange === "X"` and the bridge receives `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId: <bc.sessionId>, attachedChange: null }`
- **THEN** `bc.attachedChange === null`

#### Scenario: Ignores messages for other sessions

- **WHEN** `bc.sessionId === "S1"` and an `attach_proposal_changed` arrives with `sessionId: "S2"`
- **THEN** `bc.attachedChange` SHALL NOT change

### Requirement: New `attach_proposal_changed` server-to-extension protocol message

The shared protocol SHALL define a new variant `AttachProposalChangedExtensionMessage` of `ServerToExtensionMessage`:

```typescript
interface AttachProposalChangedExtensionMessage {
  type: "attach_proposal_changed";
  sessionId: string;
  attachedChange: string | null;
}
```

`ServerToExtensionMessage` SHALL be extended to include this variant. No other protocol messages SHALL be modified.

#### Scenario: Message variant is part of ServerToExtensionMessage union

- **WHEN** TypeScript compiles `packages/shared/src/protocol.ts`
- **THEN** `ServerToExtensionMessage` SHALL accept a value with `type: "attach_proposal_changed"`, `sessionId: string`, `attachedChange: string | null`

#### Scenario: Older bridges silently ignore unknown message type

- **WHEN** an older bridge connected to a newer server receives `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", ... }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL log-and-drop without crashing (existing default-branch behaviour in connection layer)

### Requirement: `AGENTS.override.md` shadows directory context instead of appending

pi 0.84.1 recognizes `AGENTS.override.md` as a per-directory context override that REPLACES the context files for that directory rather than adding to them. pi's own loader owns injection into the agent (`dist/core/resource-loader.js` lists the override first among its candidates and returns on first match), so the dashboard SHALL NOT reimplement that resolution.

Where the dashboard keeps its OWN notion of which files are context files — the kb agents-chain walk, the kb index doc-typing, and the kb extension's context-file name set — it SHALL treat an `AGENTS.override.md` as shadowing its siblings in the same directory, so the same logical repository scope is not surfaced twice. Ancestor inheritance SHALL be unaffected: only the overridden directory is replaced.

#### Scenario: Override shadows the sibling AGENTS.md

- **WHEN** a directory contains both `AGENTS.override.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** only the override's content SHALL be treated as that directory's context
- **AND** the sibling `AGENTS.md` SHALL NOT also be applied for that directory

#### Scenario: No override leaves inheritance untouched

- **WHEN** a directory contains no `AGENTS.override.md`
- **THEN** normal `AGENTS.md` ancestor inheritance SHALL apply unchanged

#### Scenario: Override shadows CLAUDE.md too

- **WHEN** a directory contains both `AGENTS.override.md` and `CLAUDE.md` and CLAUDE-file support is enabled
- **THEN** only the override SHALL be treated as that directory's context

#### Scenario: Override is doc-typed as a context file

- **WHEN** the kb indexer assigns a doc type to `AGENTS.override.md`
- **THEN** it SHALL be typed as an `agents` context file, not as an ordinary `doc`

#### Scenario: Pi owns injection; no dashboard feature-detection branch

- **WHEN** the running pi predates `AGENTS.override.md` support
- **THEN** that pi simply never loads such a file and normal `AGENTS.md` inheritance applies
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL NOT carry a version- or shape-gated fallback branch for it
