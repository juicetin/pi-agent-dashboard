# automation-folder-format Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-automation-plugin. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Dual-scope automation definitions on disk

Automation definitions SHALL be read from two scopes: per-folder at `<repo>/.pi/automation/<name>/` and global at `~/.pi/automation/<name>/`. Each automation directory SHALL contain an `automation.yaml`. The plugin SHALL merge both scopes for display, tagging each automation with its scope.

#### Scenario: Per-folder automation discovered

- **WHEN** a repo contains `.pi/automation/weekly-brief/automation.yaml`
- **THEN** the automation `weekly-brief` SHALL appear in that folder's Automation view with scope `folder`.

#### Scenario: Global automation discovered across folders

- **WHEN** `~/.pi/automation/nightly-bugfix/automation.yaml` exists
- **THEN** `nightly-bugfix` SHALL appear in the Automation view of any folder with scope `global`.

#### Scenario: Name collision across scopes kept distinct

- **WHEN** both `<repo>/.pi/automation/x/` and `~/.pi/automation/x/` exist
- **THEN** both SHALL be listed as separate entries distinguished by scope badge.

### Requirement: automation.yaml schema

`automation.yaml` SHALL declare `on` (trigger block with `kind`), `action`, `model` (bare provider/model id with an OPTIONAL `:<thinking>` suffix, or `@role`), `mode` (`worktree` | `local`), `sandbox` (`read-only` | `workspace-write` | `full-access`), `concurrency` (`skip` | `queue` | `parallel`, default `skip`), and an OPTIONAL `visibility` (`hidden` | `shown`) overriding the settings-level default.

The `model` value SHALL be carried verbatim to the spawned pi process's `--model` flag, which owns parsing and clamping of the `:<thinking>` suffix. Role resolution SHALL preserve any suffix present on the resolved role ref. No dashboard-side component SHALL strip, validate, or reject the suffix.

The `action` block SHALL declare `kind` set to a registered action id. Built-in ids are `core.prompt` (with a `prompt` path) and `core.skill` (with a `skill` token); a bare `kind: prompt` or `kind: skill` SHALL be accepted and normalized to the corresponding `core.*` id for backward compatibility. Plugin-registered ids SHALL use the namespaced form `<source>.<verb>`. The `action` block MAY declare an OPTIONAL `payload` map whose keys correspond to the action's `payloadSchema` fields.

`action.kind` SHALL be validated against the live action registry: an id with no registered handler SHALL fail validation, mark the automation invalid in the view with an error naming the id, and SHALL NOT prevent other automations from loading. Unknown trigger `kind` values SHALL likewise fail validation, mark the automation invalid, and SHALL NOT prevent other automations from loading.

#### Scenario: Minimal valid automation (built-in action)

- **WHEN** `automation.yaml` declares `on.kind: schedule`, `on.cron: "0 9 * * 1"`, `action.kind: prompt`, `model: "@fast"`, `mode: worktree`, `concurrency: skip`
- **THEN** it SHALL parse as valid, with `action.kind` normalized to `core.prompt`.

#### Scenario: Model with a thinking suffix reaches pi verbatim

- **WHEN** `automation.yaml` declares `model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high"` and the automation fires
- **THEN** the spawned pi argv SHALL contain `--model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high` unchanged.

#### Scenario: Role ref suffix survives resolution

- **WHEN** `automation.yaml` declares `model: "@planning"` and the role map binds `planning` to `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high"`
- **THEN** model resolution SHALL yield `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high"` and the spawn SHALL pass it unchanged.

#### Scenario: Plugin action with payload

- **WHEN** `automation.yaml` declares `action.kind: flows.run` and `action.payload: { flow: "nightly-build-and-tag", task: "build and tag" }`, and `flows.run` is registered
- **THEN** it SHALL parse as valid and the payload SHALL be carried to dispatch.

#### Scenario: Unknown action id isolates failure

- **WHEN** an automation declares `action.kind: slack.post` and no registered action handles `slack.post`
- **THEN** that automation SHALL be marked invalid with an error naming the id, and sibling automations SHALL still load and arm.

#### Scenario: Unknown trigger kind isolates failure

- **WHEN** an automation declares `on.kind: slack.message` and no registered trigger handles `slack.message`
- **THEN** that automation SHALL be marked invalid with an error naming the kind, and sibling automations SHALL still load and arm.

### Requirement: Run/triage store with retention

Each run SHALL write to `<scope>/.pi/automation/runs/<date>-<name>/result.md`. A run that produces no findings SHALL be auto-archived. The store SHALL retain at most the last 100 runs per automation, pruning oldest-first.

#### Scenario: Empty run auto-archived

- **WHEN** a run completes with no findings
- **THEN** its run record SHALL be marked archived and SHALL NOT surface as an unread Triage item.

#### Scenario: Retention prunes beyond 100

- **WHEN** a 101st run for one automation completes
- **THEN** the oldest run record for that automation SHALL be pruned, leaving 100.
