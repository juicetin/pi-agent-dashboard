# automation-trigger-registry Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-automation-plugin. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Extensible trigger registry

The plugin SHALL maintain a trigger registry mapping a trigger `kind` to a `TriggerType` with `parse(rawYaml)` and `arm(cfg, fire): Disposable`. The registry SHALL register `schedule` at boot. The registry SHALL expose a registration path so future core kinds and plugin-provided kinds can be added without changing the on-disk `automation.yaml` format.

#### Scenario: schedule kind registered at boot

- **WHEN** the plugin server entry initializes
- **THEN** the registry SHALL contain a `schedule` trigger type.

#### Scenario: Additional kind registered without format change

- **WHEN** a later registration adds kind `openspec.complete`
- **THEN** an `automation.yaml` with `on.kind: openspec.complete` SHALL parse and arm using the same schema shape (`on.kind` + kind-specific fields), with no migration of existing files.

### Requirement: Central scheduler arms schedule triggers

A single server-owned scheduler SHALL arm every valid automation's trigger. The `schedule` trigger SHALL fire per its cron expression. On config change (create/edit/delete detected via fs.watch on `.pi/automation/`), the scheduler SHALL dispose the affected trigger and re-arm from the new definition.

#### Scenario: Cron fire triggers a run

- **WHEN** a `schedule` automation's cron time arrives
- **THEN** the scheduler SHALL invoke `fire(ctx)` for that automation exactly once for that occurrence.

#### Scenario: Edit re-arms cleanly

- **WHEN** an automation's `automation.yaml` cron changes on disk
- **THEN** the prior armed trigger SHALL be disposed and a new one armed from the updated file, with no duplicate firing.

### Requirement: Restart catch-up is skip

On server restart, the scheduler SHALL recompute each automation's next-fire forward from the current time and SHALL NOT backfill fires missed while the server was down.

#### Scenario: Missed fire not backfilled

- **WHEN** the server was down across a scheduled fire time and then restarts
- **THEN** no run SHALL be created for the missed occurrence, and the next-fire SHALL be the next future cron occurrence.

### Requirement: Per-fire trigger value threaded to the action

A trigger's fire SHALL carry a per-fire value via `FireContext`, and the engine SHALL thread that value from the scheduler through the runner to action dispatch. When the run queue defers a fire (concurrency `queue`), each queued entry SHALL retain its own per-fire context so distinct fires do not collapse to a single value. At dispatch, the token `${{trigger}}` in the action payload SHALL be resolved to the per-fire value.

#### Scenario: Per-fire value reaches the action payload

- **WHEN** a trigger fires with value `/spool/inv-042.pdf` and the action payload contains `${{trigger}}`
- **THEN** the resolved payload delivered to the action SHALL contain `/spool/inv-042.pdf` in place of `${{trigger}}`.

#### Scenario: Queued fires retain distinct values

- **WHEN** a `concurrency: queue` automation fires for `a.pdf` while a prior run is active and then fires for `b.pdf`
- **THEN** the deferred runs SHALL execute in order, the first resolving `${{trigger}}` to `a.pdf` and the second to `b.pdf`.

#### Scenario: Absent trigger value resolves empty

- **WHEN** a trigger fires with no per-fire value and the payload contains `${{trigger}}`
- **THEN** `${{trigger}}` SHALL resolve to an empty string and the run SHALL still start.

### Requirement: Config watchers reconcile incrementally

The automation config watchers SHALL be reconciled against the current set of
automation scopes, not rebuilt wholesale. Reconciliation SHALL detach watchers
whose scope base is no longer present, attach watchers for newly-present scope
bases, and leave every unchanged scope base's watcher handle untouched.

A periodic rescan SHALL NOT by itself cause any watcher to be torn down and
re-established. Watcher churn SHALL be proportional to the change in the scope
set, not to the number of rescan ticks nor to the number of scopes.

#### Scenario: Steady state performs no watcher churn

- **WHEN** the set of automation scopes is unchanged between two rescans
- **THEN** no watcher SHALL be detached and no watcher handle SHALL be re-established

#### Scenario: A new scope is armed

- **WHEN** a scope base is present that has no attached watcher
- **THEN** a watcher SHALL be attached for that scope base
- **AND** watchers for already-attached scope bases SHALL remain attached

#### Scenario: A removed scope is released

- **WHEN** a previously-attached scope base is no longer in the current scope set
- **THEN** its watcher SHALL be detached
- **AND** watchers for scope bases still in the set SHALL remain attached

#### Scenario: A watcher that failed to attach does not block reconciliation

- **WHEN** attaching a watcher for a scope base fails (the automation directory is missing or `fs.watch` throws)
- **THEN** that scope base SHALL degrade to not-attached
- **AND** reconciliation of the remaining scope bases SHALL still complete

### Requirement: Armed timer honors delays beyond the 32-bit ceiling

An armed trigger's timer SHALL fire at the intended occurrence even when the delay
to that occurrence exceeds Node's `setTimeout` maximum (`2^31 − 1 ms`, ≈ 24.855
days). The scheduler SHALL NOT allow such a delay to overflow to an immediate fire
or to a repeated firing loop. The timer SHALL compute the remaining wait against the
absolute target instant on each hop (not by naive subtraction), so long waits are
split into bounded hops that remain correct across GC pauses and OS suspend/resume
while the process stays alive.

This requirement covers every trigger `kind` armed through the shared scheduler
timer seam, not the `schedule` kind alone.

#### Scenario: Long-horizon cron fires once at its occurrence

- **WHEN** a `schedule` automation's next fire is more than 24.855 days away (e.g. a
  monthly `0 0 1 * *` or yearly `0 0 1 1 *`) and the process stays alive until then
- **THEN** the trigger SHALL fire exactly once, at that occurrence
- **AND** it SHALL NOT fire early, and SHALL NOT enter a repeated immediate-fire loop

#### Scenario: In-process late arrival fires once immediately

- **WHEN** a hop of a long wait wakes at or after the target instant (e.g. the
  machine was suspended across the target while the process remained alive)
- **THEN** the trigger SHALL fire exactly once, without further delay
- **AND** it SHALL NOT fire more than once for that occurrence

#### Scenario: Dispose during a long wait leaves no pending timer

- **WHEN** an armed long-wait trigger is disposed (config edit/delete) mid-hop
- **THEN** the currently pending hop timer SHALL be cleared
- **AND** no further fire SHALL occur for that automation

### Requirement: Restart-skip unaffected by chunked timing

The chunked long-timeout SHALL exist only in process memory and SHALL NOT change the
restart-catch-up policy. On server restart, arming SHALL recompute each automation's
next fire strictly forward from the current time and SHALL NOT backfill an occurrence
missed while the process was not running.

#### Scenario: Occurrence missed while process was down is still skipped

- **WHEN** the server process was not running across a scheduled occurrence and then
  starts again at a time past that occurrence
- **THEN** no run SHALL be created for the missed occurrence
- **AND** the next armed fire SHALL be the next future cron occurrence
