## Purpose

Bash command execution events and their rendering in the dashboard chat view.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bash output event type
The dashboard event system SHALL support a `bash_output` event type for forwarding shell execution results from the extension to the browser.

The event data SHALL contain:
- `command` (string): The executed command
- `output` (string): The command's stdout/stderr output
- `exitCode` (number): The process exit code
- `excludeFromContext` (boolean): `true` for `!!` commands, `false` for `!` commands

#### Scenario: Bash output event forwarded
- **WHEN** the extension sends an `event_forward` with a `bash_output` event
- **THEN** the server SHALL store and forward the event to subscribed browsers like any other dashboard event

#### Scenario: Silent bash output marked correctly
- **WHEN** the extension executes `!!docker ps`
- **THEN** the `bash_output` event SHALL have `excludeFromContext: true`

#### Scenario: LLM bash output marked correctly
- **WHEN** the extension executes `!git diff`
- **THEN** the `bash_output` event SHALL have `excludeFromContext: false`

### Requirement: Bash output rendering in chat view
The chat view SHALL render `bash_output` events as distinct cards showing:
- The command that was executed (in monospace font)
- The output (in a scrollable pre-formatted block)
- The exit code (with visual indicator: green for 0, red for non-zero)
- A visual distinction between `!` (sent to LLM) and `!!` (silent) — e.g., a "silent" badge or dimmed style for `!!` commands

#### Scenario: Successful bash output rendered
- **WHEN** a `bash_output` event arrives with `exitCode: 0` and `excludeFromContext: false`
- **THEN** the chat view SHALL render a card with the command, output, and a green exit code indicator

#### Scenario: Failed bash output rendered
- **WHEN** a `bash_output` event arrives with `exitCode: 1`
- **THEN** the chat view SHALL render a card with the command, output, and a red exit code indicator

#### Scenario: Silent bash output rendered with badge
- **WHEN** a `bash_output` event arrives with `excludeFromContext: true`
- **THEN** the chat view SHALL render the card with a "silent" or "!!" visual badge indicating output was not sent to the LLM

### Requirement: Command feedback event type
The dashboard event system SHALL support a `command_feedback` event type for showing status of commands like `/compact`.

The event data SHALL contain:
- `command` (string): The command name (e.g., "/compact")
- `status` (string): One of `"started"`, `"completed"`, `"error"`
- `message` (string, optional): Additional context message

#### Scenario: Compact started feedback
- **WHEN** the user sends `/compact` and the extension starts compaction
- **THEN** a `command_feedback` event SHALL be sent with `status: "started"` and `command: "/compact"`

#### Scenario: Command error feedback
- **WHEN** a command fails (e.g., compact when already compacted)
- **THEN** a `command_feedback` event SHALL be sent with `status: "error"` and an error message

### Requirement: Command feedback rendering in chat view
The chat view SHALL render `command_feedback` events as inline status indicators:
- `started`: A subtle info-style card with the command name and a spinner or "in progress" indicator
- `completed`: A success-style card
- `error`: An error-style card with the error message

#### Scenario: Started feedback rendered
- **WHEN** a `command_feedback` event with `status: "started"` arrives
- **THEN** the chat view SHALL show a subtle info card (e.g., "⏳ /compact started")

#### Scenario: Error feedback rendered
- **WHEN** a `command_feedback` event with `status: "error"` arrives
- **THEN** the chat view SHALL show an error card with the error message
