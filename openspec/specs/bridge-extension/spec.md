## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dev build and server shutdown on reload cleanup
When `devBuildOnReload` is `true` in the loaded config, the bridge extension's cleanup function (called on `/reload`) SHALL perform the following before the normal cleanup:

1. Log `🔨 Dashboard: building client...` to the terminal
2. Run `execSync("npm run build", { cwd: <packageRoot>, stdio: "inherit" })` where packageRoot is resolved from `__dirname` (two levels up from `src/extension/`)
3. Log `✅ Dashboard: client built` on success, or log the error on failure
4. Log `🛑 Dashboard: stopping server...` to the terminal
5. Send `POST http://localhost:{port}/api/shutdown` (fire-and-forget)
6. Log `✅ Dashboard: server stopped`

Build or shutdown failures SHALL be caught and logged but SHALL NOT prevent the reload from completing.

#### Scenario: Cleanup with devBuildOnReload enabled
- **WHEN** `/reload` triggers the cleanup function and `config.devBuildOnReload` is `true`
- **THEN** the cleanup SHALL build the client and request server shutdown before disconnecting

#### Scenario: Cleanup with devBuildOnReload disabled
- **WHEN** `/reload` triggers the cleanup function and `config.devBuildOnReload` is `false`
- **THEN** the cleanup SHALL proceed normally without building or shutting down the server

#### Scenario: Build error is non-fatal
- **WHEN** `execSync("npm run build")` throws an error during cleanup
- **THEN** the error SHALL be logged and cleanup SHALL continue with the shutdown request

### Requirement: Retry port probe after failed server launch
When `launchServer` returns a failure result during the auto-start flow in `session_start`, the bridge extension SHALL re-probe the port using `isPortOpen(config.piPort)` before deciding whether to show a warning notification. If the re-probe returns `true` (port is now open), the bridge SHALL suppress the failure warning — another agent started the server concurrently. If the re-probe returns `false` (port is still closed), the bridge SHALL show the warning notification with the failure message.

#### Scenario: Concurrent launch — another agent started the server
- **WHEN** `launchServer` fails and the subsequent `isPortOpen` re-probe returns `true`
- **THEN** no warning notification SHALL be shown

#### Scenario: Genuine server failure
- **WHEN** `launchServer` fails and the subsequent `isPortOpen` re-probe returns `false`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL show a warning notification with the failure message

#### Scenario: Single agent — successful launch
- **WHEN** `launchServer` succeeds on the first attempt
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL show the success notification as before (no behavioral change)

### Requirement: Command routing in send_prompt handler
The bridge extension's command handler SHALL parse `send_prompt` text for `!`, `!!`, and `/` prefixes and route them to the appropriate pi APIs instead of always calling `sendUserMessage()`.

Routing order:
1. `!!<cmd>` → silent bash via `pi.exec()`, forward `bash_output` event
2. `!<cmd>` → bash via `pi.exec()`, forward `bash_output` event + send to LLM
3. `/compact [args]` → `ctx.compact()` with optional custom instructions
4. `/` prefixed → `session.prompt(text)` for extension commands, skills, templates
5. Default → `pi.sendUserMessage(text)`

#### Scenario: Bang command routed to exec
- **WHEN** `send_prompt` arrives with text `!npm test`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL call `pi.exec()` with the command, NOT `sendUserMessage()`

#### Scenario: Compact routed to ctx.compact
- **WHEN** `send_prompt` arrives with text `/compact`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL call `ctx.compact()`, NOT `sendUserMessage()`

#### Scenario: Regular text unchanged
- **WHEN** `send_prompt` arrives with text `explain this function`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL call `sendUserMessage("explain this function")` as before

### Requirement: Hidden command registration
The bridge SHALL register a `__dashboard` command via `pi.registerCommand()` during `initBridge()`. The command SHALL have no description. The commands list sent to the server SHALL filter out commands whose names start with `__`.

#### Scenario: Dashboard command registered
- **WHEN** the bridge initializes
- **THEN** `pi.registerCommand("__dashboard", ...)` SHALL be called

#### Scenario: Hidden commands filtered from list
- **WHEN** the bridge sends a `commands_list` message
- **THEN** commands with names starting with `__` SHALL be excluded

### Requirement: Cached session for prompt routing
The bridge SHALL store a reference to the agent session (from `cachedCtx`) that exposes `prompt()` for routing slash commands. The command handler SHALL receive this reference via its options/dependencies.

#### Scenario: Session reference passed to handler
- **WHEN** a slash command needs routing via `session.prompt()`
- **THEN** the command handler SHALL have access to the session's `prompt()` method through its stored context reference
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: UI proxy activation on session start
The bridge extension SHALL activate the UI proxy in the `session_start` handler. The proxy SHALL wrap `ctx.ui.confirm`, `ctx.ui.select`, `ctx.ui.input`, `ctx.ui.editor`, and `ctx.ui.notify` with dashboard-forwarding versions. The proxy SHALL receive the WebSocket connection, session ID getter, and `ctx.hasUI` flag.

#### Scenario: Proxy activated on session start
- **WHEN** the bridge's `session_start` handler fires
- **THEN** the UI proxy SHALL be applied to `ctx.ui`, replacing dialog and notify methods

#### Scenario: Proxy receives response messages
- **WHEN** the bridge's `onMessage` handler receives an `extension_ui_response` message
- **THEN** it SHALL forward the message to the UI proxy for promise resolution

### Requirement: UI proxy handles reconnection
When the bridge reconnects to the dashboard server, the UI proxy's pending requests are NOT replayed (they are tied to the original dialog call which may have already resolved or timed out). The proxy SHALL continue to work with the new connection for future dialog calls.

#### Scenario: Reconnection does not replay pending requests
- **WHEN** the bridge reconnects to the dashboard server
- **THEN** existing pending requests in the UI proxy SHALL remain in their current state (resolved by TUI or timed out)
