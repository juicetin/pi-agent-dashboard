# client-build-config Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change polish-header-logo-and-card-stripes. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Vite publicDir resolves to the project-root public/ directory
The Vite build configuration in `packages/client/vite.config.ts` SHALL set `publicDir` to a value that resolves (relative to the configured `root`) to the project-root `public/` directory containing `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `manifest.json`, and `sw.js`. With `root: "src"`, the correct relative value is `"../../../public"` (three `../` hops). The previous value `"../../public"` resolved to a non-existent `packages/public/` directory, causing Vite to silently skip copying static assets and producing a `dist/` without favicons, the PWA manifest, or the service worker.

#### Scenario: Static public assets are bundled into dist
- **WHEN** the production build runs (`npm run build`)
- **THEN** `packages/client/dist/icon-192.png` exists
- **AND** `packages/client/dist/icon-512.png` exists
- **AND** `packages/client/dist/manifest.json` exists
- **AND** `packages/client/dist/sw.js` exists

#### Scenario: Server serves the bundled icon
- **WHEN** the dashboard server runs in production mode and the client build is present
- **AND** a client requests `GET /icon-192.png`
- **THEN** the response status is 200
- **AND** the response `Content-Type` is `image/png`
- **AND** the response body is the actual PNG (NOT the SPA `index.html` fallback)

### Requirement: Vite proxy port is configurable
The Vite build configuration SHALL not hardcode `8000` as the proxy target port. The proxy port SHALL be resolved at config-load time from the dashboard configuration. See `vite-proxy-port-config` spec for the full resolution contract.

#### Scenario: Hardcoded 8000 is absent from proxy targets
- **WHEN** `packages/client/vite.config.ts` is inspected
- **THEN** neither the `"/api"` proxy target string nor the `"/ws"` proxy target string SHALL contain the literal `8000`
- **AND** the port value SHALL be derived from the config resolution helper

### Requirement: Tailwind source scan covers all plugin client packages

The Tailwind v4 entry stylesheet (`packages/client/src/index.css`) SHALL declare
`@source` directives that cover every package shipping client-side React
components with Tailwind utility classes, so that utilities referenced only in
plugin source are not purged from the production stylesheet. The scan SHALL
include one explicit `@source "../../<plugin>/src/client"` directive per
client-bearing plugin package, in addition to client-bearing packages that do
not nest under `src/client` (`client-utils/src`, `dashboard-plugin-runtime/src`).

A bare star glob over sibling `src/client` directories (e.g.
`@source "../../*/src/client"`) does NOT expand in this Tailwind v4 setup and
additionally embeds the comment-terminating `*/` sequence; explicit
enumeration is therefore required. A plugin author adding a new
`packages/<plugin>/src/client` directory SHALL add a corresponding `@source`
line so that plugin's Tailwind utilities are emitted.

#### Scenario: Goal-plugin hover utilities are emitted

- **GIVEN** `goal-plugin/src/client/FolderGoalsSection.tsx` applies
  `hover:text-indigo-400`, `hover:text-indigo-300`, and
  `hover:border-indigo-500/70`
- **WHEN** the production build runs (`npm run build`)
- **THEN** `packages/client/dist/assets/index-*.css` SHALL contain
  `hover:text-indigo-400`, `hover:text-indigo-300`, and
  `hover:border-indigo-500/70`

#### Scenario: Existing plugin utilities are not regressed

- **WHEN** the production build runs
- **THEN** the emitted stylesheet SHALL still contain `hover:text-blue-400`
  (used by the automation and openspec folder rows)

#### Scenario: Each client-bearing plugin has an explicit @source line

- **GIVEN** a plugin package `packages/<plugin>/src/client` that uses Tailwind
  utility classes
- **WHEN** `packages/client/src/index.css` is inspected
- **THEN** it SHALL contain a `@source "../../<plugin>/src/client"` directive
  for that package
- **AND** `goal-plugin` and `automation-plugin` SHALL each have such a directive

### Requirement: Production build is free of mechanical warnings

The production client build (`npm run build`, Vite + Rollup + Lightning CSS via `packages/client/vite.config.ts`) SHALL NOT emit the following warnings:

- **Lightning CSS parse errors.** Documentation prose (code comments, `AGENTS.md`
  sidecars) SHALL NOT contain literal Tailwind-shaped placeholder tokens such as
  `bg-[var(...)]` or `text-[var(...)]`, because Tailwind v4's automatic content
  scanner extracts them as real utilities that Lightning CSS cannot parse.
- **Circular manual chunk.** The `manualChunks` map SHALL NOT place two libraries that
  reference each other into separate chunks. `react-syntax-highlighter` SHALL share a
  chunk with `react-markdown` rather than occupying a separate `syntax` chunk.
- **Defeated dynamic imports for `PdfPreview` and `known-servers-api`.** Each of these
  modules SHALL be imported with a single strategy across the codebase so Rollup does
  not report `dynamic import will not move module into another chunk` for it.

This requirement does NOT cover the `@mdi/js` dynamic-import warning nor the
oversized-chunk (>700 kB) warning; those are owned by the `shrink-client-index-chunk`
change.

#### Scenario: No CSS parse, circular-chunk, or targeted dynamic-import warnings

- **WHEN** the production build runs (`npm run build`)
- **THEN** stderr/stdout SHALL NOT contain `Unexpected token`
- **AND** SHALL NOT contain `Circular chunk`
- **AND** SHALL NOT contain a `dynamic import will not move module into another chunk`
  line naming `PdfPreview.tsx` or `known-servers-api.ts`

#### Scenario: No placeholder utility tokens in scanned source

- **WHEN** `packages/client/src/lib/session/session-status-visuals.ts` and its
  `.AGENTS.md` sidecar are inspected
- **THEN** neither SHALL contain the literal token `bg-[var(...)]` or `text-[var(...)]`

### Requirement: @mdi/js is isolated from the eager entry chunk

The `@mdi/js` icon set SHALL NOT be inlined into the client `index` entry chunk, and
the build SHALL NOT report a `dynamic import will not move module into another chunk`
warning for `@mdi/js`.

- `@mdi/js` SHALL be assigned its own `manualChunks` entry in
  `packages/client/vite.config.ts`, so the icon set is emitted as a dedicated `mdi`
  chunk rather than inlined into `index`.
- The two dynamic `import("@mdi/js")` sites (`ActionList.tsx`, `StatusPill.tsx`) SHALL be
  converted to static imports so no module is imported both dynamically and statically —
  a `manualChunks` entry alone does NOT silence that warning.
- The icon-by-key resolver SHALL keep resolving arbitrary extension-supplied keys (the
  full namespace is retained; no tree-shaking).

This requirement does NOT cover the oversized-chunk (>700 kB) aggregate warning;
`chunkSizeWarningLimit` remains at 700 and that warning is an accepted, documented notice
(`monaco` is intentionally large and lazy).

#### Scenario: @mdi/js is a dedicated chunk, out of the entry chunk

- **WHEN** the production build runs (`npm run build`)
- **THEN** a `mdi-*.js` chunk is emitted in `dist/assets`
- **AND** the main entry chunk (resolved from `index.html`) does NOT contain `@mdi/js`
  icon export markers (e.g. `mdiZodiacAquarius`)
- **AND** the gzipped `index` chunk is ≤ 900 KB (baseline ~1388 KB before this change)

#### Scenario: No @mdi/js dynamic-import warning

- **WHEN** the production build runs
- **THEN** the build log contains no `dynamic import will not move module into another
  chunk` line naming `@mdi/js`

#### Scenario: Icon-by-key still resolves arbitrary keys

- **WHEN** an `ActionList` / `StatusPill` renders with a valid MDI key (e.g. `mdiRefresh`)
- **THEN** the corresponding icon path renders
- **AND** an unknown key renders nothing without throwing
