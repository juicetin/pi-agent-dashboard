### Requirement: Visible disconnection banner
The dashboard SHALL display a persistent banner above the main UI shell whenever the active client WebSocket has been in a non-`OPEN` state continuously for more than 3 seconds. The banner SHALL clearly identify the targeted server and indicate that retries are in progress.

#### Scenario: Banner appears after threshold
- **WHEN** the active WebSocket has been in a non-`OPEN` state for more than 3 seconds
- **THEN** a banner SHALL be rendered above the main UI shell
- **AND** the banner SHALL contain the text "Disconnected from <host>. Retrying…" where `<host>` is the currently-targeted server

#### Scenario: Banner hidden when connected
- **WHEN** the active WebSocket is in the `OPEN` state
- **THEN** no banner SHALL be visible

#### Scenario: Brief disconnects do not show banner
- **WHEN** the active WebSocket is in a non-`OPEN` state for less than 3 seconds and then returns to `OPEN`
- **THEN** the banner SHALL NOT be displayed at any point during the brief disconnect

#### Scenario: Banner does not appear during staging switch
- **WHEN** a staging WebSocket switch is in progress and the live WebSocket is still `OPEN`
- **THEN** the banner SHALL NOT be displayed, because no disconnection has occurred

### Requirement: Switch-server action in banner
The disconnection banner SHALL provide a visible affordance that lets the user open the server selector dropdown without relying on the header icon.

#### Scenario: Open server selector from banner
- **WHEN** the banner is visible and the user clicks the banner's "Switch server" action
- **THEN** the server selector dropdown SHALL open
- **AND** the user SHALL be able to choose a different server to switch to

### Requirement: Banner hidden immediately on successful reconnect
The banner SHALL disappear as soon as the active WebSocket transitions back to `OPEN`, with no additional delay or fade-out that could leave stale messaging visible.

#### Scenario: Banner hides on reconnect
- **WHEN** the active WebSocket transitions from a non-`OPEN` state back to `OPEN`
- **THEN** the banner SHALL be hidden in the next render cycle
