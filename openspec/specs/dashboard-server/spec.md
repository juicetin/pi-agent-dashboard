## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Shutdown REST endpoint
The dashboard server SHALL expose a `POST /api/shutdown` endpoint that gracefully stops the server process. When called, it SHALL invoke the server's `stop()` method and then exit the process with code 0.

#### Scenario: Shutdown request
- **WHEN** a `POST /api/shutdown` request is received
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ ok: true }`, call `server.stop()`, and exit with `process.exit(0)`

#### Scenario: Shutdown during active sessions
- **WHEN** `POST /api/shutdown` is received while pi sessions are connected
- **THEN** the server SHALL still shut down gracefully — connected extensions will reconnect when a new server starts

### Requirement: Health endpoint
The dashboard server SHALL expose a `GET /api/health` endpoint that returns server liveness information including process ID and uptime.

#### Scenario: Health check response
- **WHEN** a `GET /api/health` request is received

#### Scenario: Health check from localhost
- **WHEN** a `GET /api/health` request is received from any origin
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond successfully (no localhost guard on health endpoint)

### Requirement: Conditional auth plugin registration
The server SHALL register the auth module as a Fastify plugin only when `auth` is present in the loaded config and has at least one provider configured. When auth is not configured, no auth hooks or routes SHALL be registered.

#### Scenario: Auth configured with providers
- **WHEN** the server starts and config contains `auth` with at least one provider
- **THEN** the server SHALL register the auth plugin, adding auth routes and the `onRequest` hook

#### Scenario: Auth not configured
- **WHEN** the server starts and config has no `auth` key
- **THEN** the server SHALL not register any auth plugin, hooks, or routes

### Requirement: WebSocket upgrade auth check
The server's `upgrade` handler SHALL validate authentication for non-localhost WebSocket upgrade requests when auth is enabled. The check SHALL parse the `cookie` header from the upgrade request and validate the JWT.

#### Scenario: External WebSocket upgrade with valid cookie
- **WHEN** a non-localhost WebSocket upgrade request includes a valid `pi_dash_token` cookie
- **THEN** the upgrade SHALL proceed normally

#### Scenario: External WebSocket upgrade without valid cookie
- **WHEN** a non-localhost WebSocket upgrade request has no valid `pi_dash_token` cookie and auth is enabled
- **THEN** the server SHALL destroy the socket with HTTP 401

#### Scenario: Localhost WebSocket upgrade — no check
- **WHEN** a localhost WebSocket upgrade request arrives (regardless of auth config)
- **THEN** the upgrade SHALL proceed without cookie validation

### Requirement: Auth routes excluded from localhost guard
The auth routes (`/auth/*`) SHALL NOT be subject to the localhost guard. They MUST be accessible from external IPs so that OAuth callbacks and login flows work through the tunnel.

#### Scenario: External access to /auth/callback
- **WHEN** a non-localhost request hits `/auth/callback/github`
- **THEN** the request SHALL be processed (not blocked by localhost guard)

#### Scenario: External access to /auth/login
- **WHEN** a non-localhost request hits `/auth/login`
- **THEN** the request SHALL return the login page or redirect to the provider

### Requirement: Config REST endpoints
The server SHALL expose `GET /api/config` and `PUT /api/config` endpoints, both protected by `localhostGuard`.

#### Scenario: Config endpoints registered
- **WHEN** the server starts
- **THEN** `GET /api/config` and `PUT /api/config` SHALL be available with `localhostGuard` preHandler

### Requirement: Runtime config reload
The server SHALL support runtime config reloading when `PUT /api/config` is called. A `reloadConfig(partial)` function SHALL merge, persist, and apply changes to the running server instance.

#### Scenario: Config reload applies runtime changes
- **WHEN** `PUT /api/config` writes new config
- **THEN** the server SHALL call `reloadConfig()` to apply hot-swappable settings

### Requirement: Session prompt REST endpoint

- **THEN** the server SHALL clear the session's attached proposal and respond with `{ success: true }`

### Requirement: TypeScript loader passed as file:// URL
All call sites that spawn the dashboard server with `node --import <loader> <entry-script>` SHALL pass both the loader argument AND the entry-script argument as `file://` URLs, not raw filesystem paths. This covers the jiti register hook, the tsx fallback, and the entry-script path resolved via `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`.

#### Scenario: resolveJitiImport returns file URL
- **WHEN** `resolveJitiImport()` resolves jiti successfully on any platform
- **THEN** the returned string SHALL start with `file://` and SHALL be accepted by `new URL(...)` without throwing

#### Scenario: Electron jiti resolver returns file URL
- **WHEN** `resolveJitiFromAnchor()` in `server-lifecycle.ts` resolves jiti successfully
- **THEN** the returned string SHALL be a `file://` URL

#### Scenario: tsx fallback returns file URL
- **WHEN** `cmdStart` falls back to the tsx loader (jiti resolution failed)
- **THEN** the loader path passed to `--import` SHALL be a `file://` URL

#### Scenario: Entry-script argument is a file:// URL
- **WHEN** any server-spawn call site constructs argv of the form `node --import <loader> <entry> <args...>`
- **THEN** the `<entry>` argument SHALL be a `file://` URL
- **AND** SHALL NOT be a raw filesystem path

#### Scenario: Windows drive-letter loader path no longer crashes
- **WHEN** the loader file lives on a drive whose single-letter prefix collides with URL-scheme parsing (e.g. `B:\...\jiti-register.mjs`) on Windows
- **THEN** `node --import <loader> <entry>` SHALL start the server successfully
- **AND** SHALL NOT produce `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`

#### Scenario: Windows drive-letter entry-script path no longer crashes
- **WHEN** the dashboard source lives on a drive whose single-letter prefix collides with URL-scheme parsing (e.g. `B:\Dev\...\cli.ts`) on Windows
- **AND** the user invokes `pi-dashboard start`, the bridge auto-starts the server, the Electron app spawns the server, or `POST /api/restart` is called
- **THEN** the spawned Node process SHALL load the entry script successfully
- **AND** SHALL NOT produce `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`

### Requirement: Centralized helper for Node ESM-loader argv construction
The repository SHALL expose a helper (`toFileUrl` and `spawnNodeScript` in `packages/shared/src/platform/node-spawn.ts`) that is the canonical way to build argv for `node --import <loader> <entry>` spawns. `toFileUrl` SHALL be pure, idempotent, and correctly wrap Windows drive-letter paths regardless of host OS so the Windows contract can be unit-tested on Linux and macOS. `spawnNodeScript` SHALL wrap both the loader and entry positions with `toFileUrl` before spawning.

#### Scenario: toFileUrl is idempotent on file:// URLs
- **WHEN** `toFileUrl("file:///C:/foo.ts")` is called
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `"file:///C:/foo.ts"` unchanged

#### Scenario: toFileUrl wraps Windows drive-letter paths on any host
- **WHEN** `toFileUrl("B:\\Dev\\cli.ts")` or `toFileUrl("B:/Dev/cli.ts")` is called on Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `"file:///B:/Dev/cli.ts"`

#### Scenario: toFileUrl wraps POSIX absolute paths
- **WHEN** `toFileUrl("/usr/local/bin/cli.js")` is called on any host
- **THEN** the helper SHALL return `"file:///usr/local/bin/cli.js"`

#### Scenario: spawnNodeScript wraps both loader and entry
- **WHEN** `spawnNodeScript({ loader, entry, args })` is invoked with raw OS paths
- **THEN** the resulting argv SHALL equal `["--import", toFileUrl(loader), toFileUrl(entry), ...args]`

### Requirement: CI detects raw paths passed to Node ESM loader
The test suite SHALL include a lint-style check that scans the source tree for `spawn(...)` calls whose argv passes `"--import"` or `"--loader"` followed by a raw filesystem path (i.e. not routed through `toFileUrl` or `pathToFileURL`). Violations SHALL fail CI with a message identifying file and line number. This guard mirrors the existing `no-direct-child-process.test.ts` and `no-direct-process-kill.test.ts` patterns and prevents regression when future contributors add a new spawn site.

#### Scenario: Lint passes on the current codebase
- **WHEN** `npm test` is run after the migration
- **THEN** the lint test SHALL report zero violations

#### Scenario: Lint detects a staged violation fixture
- **GIVEN** a test fixture containing `spawn(process.execPath, ["--import", loader, rawPath])` where `rawPath` is not wrapped
- **WHEN** the lint scanner runs against the fixture
- **THEN** the scanner SHALL report the fixture's file and line number as a violation

### Requirement: Cross-platform /api/restart
The `POST /api/restart` endpoint SHALL restart the server without depending on `sh`, `lsof`, or `curl`. Implementation SHALL use Node built-ins (`child_process.spawn(process.execPath, ...)`, `net` for port probing, `http` for health polling) so it works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Scenario: Restart on Windows
- **WHEN** `POST /api/restart` is called on Windows
- **THEN** the server SHALL shut down, spawn a new server process via `process.execPath`, wait for the new server's `/api/health` to return `{ ok: true }`, and the endpoint SHALL have returned `{ ok: true }` before exit
- **AND** no `sh`, `lsof`, or `curl` invocation SHALL be performed

#### Scenario: Restart on Unix unchanged
- **WHEN** `POST /api/restart` is called on macOS or Linux
- **THEN** the restart SHALL complete successfully with the same externally-observable behavior as before this change

#### Scenario: Restart preserves dev/prod mode
- **WHEN** `POST /api/restart` is called with body `{ dev: true }` or `{ dev: false }`
- **THEN** the new server SHALL be spawned in the requested mode

#### Scenario: Restart health check failure is logged
- **WHEN** the new server does not become healthy within the poll deadline
- **THEN** the failure SHALL be appended to `~/.pi/dashboard/restart.log` with a timestamp

### Requirement: Cross-platform stale-port cleanup
The CLI's port-holder detection (used by `pi-dashboard start` when the configured port is already bound) SHALL work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. On Unix, `lsof -t -i :<port>` SHALL be used. On Windows, `netstat -ano` output SHALL be parsed for the listening PID and `taskkill /F /PID <pid>` SHALL be used to free the port.

#### Scenario: Stale PID freed on Windows
- **WHEN** `pi-dashboard start` runs on Windows and a stale server process is holding the configured port
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL identify the PID via `netstat -ano` and terminate it via `taskkill`
- **AND** the new server SHALL then start successfully

#### Scenario: Best-effort cleanup on parse failure
- **WHEN** `netstat` output cannot be parsed (unexpected format, permission denied, etc.)
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL proceed to the normal "port in use" error path without throwing

#### Scenario: Unix behavior unchanged
- **WHEN** `pi-dashboard start` runs on macOS or Linux
- **THEN** the existing `lsof`-based cleanup SHALL continue to work unchanged

### Requirement: server.log is appended across restarts
The daemon `server.log` at `~/.pi/dashboard/server.log` SHALL be opened in append mode so crash output from prior start attempts is preserved. Each start attempt SHALL emit a timestamped header line so successive runs can be distinguished.

#### Scenario: Append mode preserves history
- **WHEN** `pi-dashboard start` is run twice in succession and the first run wrote error output
- **THEN** `~/.pi/dashboard/server.log` SHALL contain both runs' output after the second run completes

#### Scenario: Timestamped headers
- **WHEN** a new daemon start attempt opens the log file
- **THEN** the first line of that attempt SHALL be a timestamp line distinguishing it from prior runs

### Requirement: Untracked-file synthetic diff uses Node fs
The session-diff synthetic-diff path for untracked files SHALL read file content using `fs.readFileSync`, not `execSync("cat ...")`. This SHALL work identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Scenario: Untracked file diff on Windows
- **WHEN** the session diff API encounters an untracked file on Windows
- **THEN** the synthetic diff SHALL be generated from file content read via `fs.readFileSync`
- **AND** no `cat` invocation SHALL be attempted

### Requirement: Pi-process safety check is platform-guarded
The `isPiProcess(pid)` safety check (used before SIGKILL) SHALL return `true` on Windows without attempting `ps` or `/proc` lookups. Its Unix implementation SHALL remain unchanged. The check SHALL never throw on any supported platform.

#### Scenario: Windows returns true without throwing
- **WHEN** `isPiProcess(pid)` is called on Windows
- **THEN** it SHALL return a boolean without invoking Unix-only commands
- **AND** SHALL NOT throw

#### Scenario: Unix behavior unchanged
- **WHEN** `isPiProcess(pid)` is called on macOS or Linux
- **THEN** it SHALL use `ps` (darwin) or `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` (linux) as before
