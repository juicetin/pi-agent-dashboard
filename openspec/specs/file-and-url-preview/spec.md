# file-and-url-preview Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change render-file-previews. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: ViewTarget discriminated union

The dashboard SHALL define a `ViewTarget` discriminated union in `packages/shared/src/types.ts` with exactly two variants: `{ kind: "file"; cwd: string; path: string }` and `{ kind: "url"; url: string }`. `ChatMessage` SHALL gain an optional `view?: ViewTarget` field; the existing `content`, `role`, `id`, and other fields remain unchanged. The addition is additive — existing serialized messages without a `view` field deserialize successfully.

#### Scenario: File target shape

- **GIVEN** the user runs `/view @docs/foo.md` while in a session with `cwd = "/home/u/proj"`
- **WHEN** the composer constructs a `ViewTarget`
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: "file", cwd: "/home/u/proj", path: "docs/foo.md" }`

#### Scenario: URL target shape

- **GIVEN** the user runs `/view https://youtu.be/abc123`
- **WHEN** the composer constructs a `ViewTarget`
- **THEN** the result is `{ kind: "url", url: "https://youtu.be/abc123" }`

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility

- **GIVEN** a `ChatMessage` serialized before this change (no `view` field)
- **WHEN** deserialized by code that includes this change
- **THEN** the resulting object has `view === undefined` and all other fields intact

### Requirement: Renderer dispatch is purely shape-based

A pure function `dispatchPreview(target: ViewTarget): RendererKind` SHALL select the renderer using only the target's shape (extension for files; host + URL extension for URLs). It SHALL NOT perform server round-trips, MIME sniffing, or file reads to make the decision. `RendererKind` SHALL be one of `"markdown" | "asciidoc" | "html" | "pdf" | "video" | "image" | "youtube" | "fallback"`.

#### Scenario: Markdown extension

- **WHEN** `dispatchPreview({ kind: "file", cwd, path: "x.md" })` is called
- **THEN** the result is `"markdown"`

#### Scenario: AsciiDoc extensions

- **WHEN** the file extension is `.adoc` or `.asciidoc` (case-insensitive)
- **THEN** the result is `"asciidoc"`

#### Scenario: PDF extension

- **WHEN** the file extension is `.pdf`
- **THEN** the result is `"pdf"`

#### Scenario: Video extensions

- **WHEN** the file extension is one of `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`
- **THEN** the result is `"video"`

#### Scenario: Image extensions

- **WHEN** the file extension is one of `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.webp`
- **THEN** the result is `"image"`

#### Scenario: HTML extension

- **WHEN** the file extension is `.html` or `.htm`
- **THEN** the result is `"html"`

#### Scenario: YouTube hosts

- **WHEN** the URL host is one of `youtube.com`, `www.youtube.com`, `m.youtube.com`, `youtu.be`
- **THEN** the result is `"youtube"`

#### Scenario: Unknown file extension

- **WHEN** the file extension is unrecognized (e.g. `.dat`)
- **THEN** the result is `"fallback"`

#### Scenario: Unknown URL with no known extension

- **WHEN** the URL is `https://example.com/foo` (no extension, no known host)
- **THEN** the result is `"fallback"`

### Requirement: Binary-safe file serving endpoint

The server SHALL expose `GET /api/file/raw?cwd=&path=` that streams the file contents with `Content-Type` derived from the file extension via a shared `extToContentType` mapping. The endpoint SHALL enforce the same anti-traversal gate as `/api/file`: `cwd` must match a known session cwd, and `path.resolve(cwd, relPath)` must remain inside `cwd`. The endpoint SHALL support HTTP `Range` requests so `<video>` seek bars work.

#### Scenario: Unknown cwd rejected

- **GIVEN** `cwd` is not present in any active session
- **WHEN** the client requests `/api/file/raw?cwd=/unknown&path=foo.pdf`
- **THEN** the server responds with HTTP 403 and `{ success: false, error: "unknown session path" }`

#### Scenario: Path traversal rejected

- **GIVEN** `cwd` is a known session cwd
- **WHEN** the client requests `/api/file/raw?cwd=/home/u/proj&path=../../../etc/passwd`
- **THEN** the server responds with HTTP 403 and `{ success: false, error: "path outside working directory" }`

#### Scenario: PDF served with correct Content-Type

- **GIVEN** `foo.pdf` exists inside a known cwd
- **WHEN** the client requests `/api/file/raw?cwd=…&path=foo.pdf`
- **THEN** the response Content-Type is `application/pdf` and the body is the raw file bytes

#### Scenario: Range request returns 206

- **GIVEN** `video.mp4` exists inside a known cwd
- **WHEN** the client requests with `Range: bytes=1024-2047`
- **THEN** the response status is 206 (Partial Content) with the requested byte range and a `Content-Range` header

#### Scenario: Missing file returns 404

- **GIVEN** the resolved path does not exist on disk
- **WHEN** the client requests `/api/file/raw`
- **THEN** the response status is 404

### Requirement: AsciiDoc rendering endpoint

The server SHALL expose `GET /api/file/render?cwd=&path=` that runs `asciidoctor` in `safe: "secure"` mode against the file and returns `{ success: true, data: { html } }`. It SHALL reject any extension other than `.adoc` / `.asciidoc` with HTTP 400. It SHALL enforce the same anti-traversal gate as `/api/file/raw`.

#### Scenario: AsciiDoc rendered to sanitized HTML

- **GIVEN** `notes.adoc` exists in a known cwd and contains valid AsciiDoc
- **WHEN** the client requests `/api/file/render?cwd=…&path=notes.adoc`
- **THEN** the response is `{ success: true, data: { html: "<HTML>" } }` with HTML safe to render via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

#### Scenario: Non-AsciiDoc rejected

- **WHEN** the path's extension is `.md`
- **THEN** the response status is 400 and `{ success: false, error: "renderer not supported for extension" }`

#### Scenario: Secure mode neutralizes includes

- **GIVEN** `evil.adoc` contains `include::/etc/passwd[]`
- **WHEN** rendered through this endpoint
- **THEN** the returned HTML does NOT contain `/etc/passwd` contents (the include directive is neutralized by `safe: "secure"`)

### Requirement: HTML preview is sandboxed without script execution

The `HtmlPreview` component SHALL render local `.html` files in an `<iframe>` with the `sandbox` attribute set to `allow-same-origin` only. It SHALL NOT include `allow-scripts`, `allow-forms`, `allow-top-navigation`, or `allow-popups`. The iframe `srcdoc` attribute SHALL be populated with the file contents fetched from `/api/file/raw`.

#### Scenario: Sandbox excludes scripts

- **GIVEN** a local `.html` file containing a `<script>` tag
- **WHEN** the user opens it through `/view @file.html`
- **THEN** the iframe sandbox is `"allow-same-origin"` and the `<script>` does not execute (sandbox without `allow-scripts` blocks all script execution)

#### Scenario: Chat HTML content NOT rendered

- **GIVEN** an agent message contains an `<html>` block in its content
- **WHEN** the message renders in `ChatView`
- **THEN** the existing markdown / text rendering path runs; the `HtmlPreview` component does NOT render chat content (HtmlPreview is only invoked from `/view @<file>.html`)

### Requirement: PDF preview ships as a lazy chunk

The `PdfPreview` component SHALL be imported via dynamic `import()` (`React.lazy`) so that the `pdfjs-dist` dependency does NOT appear in the main client bundle. The build output SHALL place pdfjs in a separate chunk loaded only when a PDF preview mounts.

#### Scenario: Main bundle excludes pdfjs

- **WHEN** `npm run build` runs
- **THEN** the main entry chunk (`assets/index-*.js`) does NOT contain `pdfjs-dist`
- **AND** a separate chunk containing `pdfjs-dist` exists

### Requirement: Inline + overlay surfaces share renderers

Every renderer (`MarkdownPreview`, `AsciiDocPreview`, `HtmlPreview`, `PdfPreview`, `VideoPreview`, `ImagePreview`, `YouTubePreview`, `FallbackPreview`) SHALL be usable in two contexts: inline within `PreviewCard` (in-chat) and full-screen within the `/view` overlay route. The renderer component SHALL NOT contain navigation or surface chrome; the shell is owned by `PreviewCard` (inline) or the overlay route component (full-screen).

#### Scenario: Same component, two shells

- **GIVEN** the inline `PreviewCard` displays a `.pdf` target
- **WHEN** the user clicks the `⤢ expand` icon
- **THEN** the overlay route mounts the SAME `PdfPreview` component with the same `target` prop (no separate fullscreen variant component)

### Requirement: Inline size caps prevent runaway height

`PreviewCard` SHALL apply size caps to the inline renderer per the design.md D2 policy: markdown/asciidoc/html capped at `max-h-[60vh]` with internal scroll; pdf fixed at `h-[60vh]`; video/youtube at 16:9 aspect ratio with `max-w-full`; image capped at `max-h-[40vh] max-w-full`.

#### Scenario: Large markdown does not stretch chat

- **GIVEN** the target is a 10,000-line markdown file
- **WHEN** the `PreviewCard` mounts in chat
- **THEN** the card height is at most 60vh and the body scrolls internally

#### Scenario: Image dimensions capped

- **GIVEN** the target is a 4000×3000 image
- **WHEN** the `PreviewCard` mounts in chat
- **THEN** the image scales to fit within `max-h-[40vh]` and `max-w-full` without overflow
