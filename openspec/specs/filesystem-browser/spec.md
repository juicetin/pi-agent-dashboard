## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Directory browse API
The server SHALL expose `GET /api/browse?path=<dir>&q=<query>` (localhost-only) that returns directory entries for the given path. The response SHALL include `{ success: true, data: { entries: Array<{ name, path, isGit, isPi }>, parent: string | null, current: string } }`. Only directories SHALL be listed (no files). Hidden directories (names starting with `.`) SHALL be excluded. If `path` is omitted, it SHALL default to the user's home directory. The entry limit SHALL be 200, applied AFTER filtering and ranking so best matches are never truncated.

When `q` is omitted or empty, entries SHALL be sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive).

When `q` is provided, entries SHALL be filtered case-insensitively by substring on `name` and SHALL be ranked into the following tiers, alphabetical within each tier:
- **Tier 0** — exact case-insensitive match of `name` against `q`.
- **Tier 1** — `name` starts with `q` (case-insensitive).
- **Tier 2** — `q` occurs in `name` at a word boundary (preceded by the start of the string or by one of `-`, `_`, `.`, ` `, `/`), case-insensitive.
- **Tier 3** — `q` occurs anywhere in `name` (case-insensitive).

#### Scenario: Browse valid directory
- **WHEN** a GET request is made to `/api/browse?path=/home/user/projects`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return a list of subdirectories with `isGit` and `isPi` flags indicating presence of `.git` and `.pi` directories

#### Scenario: Browse home directory (default)
- **WHEN** a GET request is made to `/api/browse` without a path parameter
- **THEN** the server SHALL return entries for the user's home directory (`os.homedir()`)

#### Scenario: Browse non-existent directory
- **WHEN** a GET request is made with a path that does not exist
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "directory not found" }`

#### Scenario: Parent path included
- **WHEN** a directory listing is returned for `/home/user/projects`
- **THEN** the `parent` field SHALL be `/home/user`

#### Scenario: Root directory has no parent
- **WHEN** a directory listing is returned for `/`
- **THEN** the `parent` field SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Remote access blocked
- **WHEN** a GET request originates from a non-loopback address
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "localhost only" }`

#### Scenario: Hidden directories excluded
- **WHEN** a directory contains subdirectories like `.config`, `.cache`, `projects`
- **THEN** only `projects` SHALL appear in the entries (hidden dirs excluded)

#### Scenario: Entry limit applies after filtering
- **WHEN** a directory contains 300 subdirectories and `q=pi` is supplied
- **THEN** the server SHALL filter and rank first, then return at most 200 entries
- **AND** a directory named `pi-dashboard` SHALL appear in the results even if alphabetically past position 200

#### Scenario: Substring filter returns non-prefix matches
- **WHEN** a GET request is made with `q=dash` against a directory containing `pi-dashboard`, `my-dashboard-old`, and `readme`
- **THEN** `pi-dashboard` and `my-dashboard-old` SHALL appear in the results
- **AND** `readme` SHALL NOT appear

#### Scenario: Ranking by tier
- **WHEN** a GET request is made with `q=pi` against a directory containing `pi` (tier 0), `pi-core` (tier 1), `my-pi-tools` (tier 2), and `epiphany` (tier 3)
- **THEN** the entries SHALL be returned in the order `pi`, `pi-core`, `my-pi-tools`, `epiphany`

#### Scenario: Alphabetical order within tier
- **WHEN** two entries are in the same rank tier (e.g. both match `pi` as prefix)
- **THEN** they SHALL appear in case-insensitive alphabetical order

#### Scenario: Empty query treated as no filter
- **WHEN** `q` is an empty string or only whitespace
- **THEN** the server SHALL behave as if `q` were omitted (alphabetical, unfiltered)

### Requirement: Directory create API
The server SHALL expose `POST /api/browse/mkdir` (localhost-only) that creates a new directory under a specified parent. The request body SHALL be `{ parent: string, name: string }`. On success the response SHALL be `{ success: true, data: { path: string } }` where `path` is the absolute path of the created directory.

The server SHALL validate:
- `parent` is an absolute path, exists on disk, and is a directory.
- `name` is non-empty after trimming, is not `.` or `..`, contains no `/` or backslash or `\0`, and has no leading or trailing whitespace.

Directory creation SHALL be non-recursive (`fs.mkdir` without `recursive: true`): if the target already exists the server SHALL fail rather than silently succeed.

#### Scenario: Create a new folder
- **WHEN** a POST request is made to `/api/browse/mkdir` with body `{ parent: "/home/user/projects", name: "new-thing" }` and `/home/user/projects/new-thing` does not exist
- **THEN** the server SHALL create the directory and return `{ success: true, data: { path: "/home/user/projects/new-thing" } }`

#### Scenario: Parent does not exist
- **WHEN** `parent` points to a non-existent path
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "parent not found" }`

#### Scenario: Parent is a file
- **WHEN** `parent` points to a regular file
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "parent is not a directory" }`

#### Scenario: Target already exists
- **WHEN** a directory with that `name` already exists under `parent`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "already exists" }`

#### Scenario: Invalid name - path separator
- **WHEN** `name` contains `/` or backslash (e.g. `"foo/bar"`)
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "invalid name" }` and SHALL NOT create any directory

#### Scenario: Invalid name - traversal
- **WHEN** `name` is `.` or `..`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "invalid name" }` and SHALL NOT create any directory

#### Scenario: Invalid name - null byte
- **WHEN** `name` contains a null byte (`\0`)
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "invalid name" }` and SHALL NOT create any directory

#### Scenario: Invalid name - empty or whitespace
- **WHEN** `name` is empty, whitespace-only, or has leading/trailing whitespace
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "invalid name" }` and SHALL NOT create any directory

#### Scenario: Remote access blocked
- **WHEN** a POST request originates from a non-loopback address
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ success: false, error: "localhost only" }` and SHALL NOT create any directory

### Requirement: PathPicker component
The web client SHALL provide a reusable `PathPicker` component combining a text input with a fixed-height scrollable directory list for keyboard-first filesystem navigation.

The component SHALL display:
- Text input (always focused) showing the current path with cursor
- Fixed-height directory list (configurable rows, default 8) below the input
- `..` entry at the top of the list for parent navigation (except at root)
- Visual indicators for git repos (`isGit`) and pi projects (`isPi`)
- Highlight on the currently selected list entry
- A footer with **Cancel**, **＋ New folder**, and **Select** buttons
- When the typed partial has no exact match, an inline **"＋ Create \"&lt;name&gt;\" here"** row at the end of the list

The component SHALL send the typed partial to the server as the `q` query parameter so filtering and ranking happen server-side. Requests SHALL be debounced at 150ms and older in-flight requests SHALL be cancelled when a newer input state is sent.

#### Scenario: Open PathPicker
- **WHEN** PathPicker mounts with `initialPath="/Users/robson/"`
- **THEN** the input SHALL show `/Users/robson/` and the list SHALL show subdirectories of that path

#### Scenario: Open PathPicker without initialPath
- **WHEN** PathPicker mounts without `initialPath`
- **THEN** it SHALL default to the user's home directory

#### Scenario: Type to filter (substring, server-side)
- **WHEN** the user types characters after the last `/` in the input
- **THEN** the component SHALL send the typed partial to `/api/browse` as `q` (debounced 150ms)
- **AND** the list SHALL display the server's ranked substring-filtered results in returned order
- **AND** the highlight SHALL reset to the first list entry

#### Scenario: Arrow key navigation
- **WHEN** the user presses ↓ or ↑
- **THEN** the highlight SHALL move through the filtered list entries (including the inline "Create here" row when present)
- **AND** focus SHALL remain in the text input

#### Scenario: Tab descends into directory
- **WHEN** the user presses Tab with a highlighted entry
- **THEN** the input SHALL become `parentPath + highlightedEntry + /`
- **AND** the list SHALL fetch and show the contents of that directory

#### Scenario: Single match auto-complete
- **WHEN** only one entry matches the typed partial
- **THEN** Tab SHALL complete that entry without requiring arrow key selection first

#### Scenario: Enter on exact match selects and closes
- **WHEN** the user presses Enter AND the trimmed partial matches a visible entry name (case-insensitive)
- **THEN** `onSelect` SHALL be called with that entry's absolute path
- **AND** the picker SHALL close

#### Scenario: Enter on trailing-slash current directory selects and closes
- **WHEN** the user presses Enter AND the input ends with `/` AND the parsed parent equals the currently-fetched directory
- **THEN** `onSelect` SHALL be called with the current input value
- **AND** the picker SHALL close

#### Scenario: Enter on single candidate completes (does not close)
- **WHEN** the user presses Enter AND there is exactly one filtered candidate AND the partial is NOT an exact match
- **THEN** the input SHALL become `candidate.path + "/"`
- **AND** the list SHALL refetch for the new directory
- **AND** `onSelect` SHALL NOT be called

#### Scenario: Enter on non-existent path is a no-op
- **WHEN** the user presses Enter AND none of the above rules apply (no exact match, zero or multiple candidates, input does not end with `/`)
- **THEN** `onSelect` SHALL NOT be called
- **AND** the picker SHALL remain open
- **AND** the input SHALL show a brief visual "invalid" indicator (e.g. red outline or shake)

#### Scenario: Select button follows Enter rules
- **WHEN** the user clicks the footer Select button
- **THEN** the component SHALL apply the same rules as Enter above (never confirming a non-existent path)

#### Scenario: Escape cancels
- **WHEN** the user presses Escape
- **THEN** `onCancel` SHALL be called

#### Scenario: Click entry descends
- **WHEN** the user clicks a directory entry in the list
- **THEN** the input SHALL become that entry's path + `/`
- **AND** the list SHALL fetch and show the contents of that directory

#### Scenario: Click `..` goes up
- **WHEN** the user clicks the `..` entry
- **THEN** the input SHALL navigate to the parent directory
- **AND** the list SHALL show the parent's contents

#### Scenario: Backspace past slash
- **WHEN** the user backspaces past a `/` separator
- **THEN** the resolved parent SHALL change to the grandparent directory
- **AND** the list SHALL fetch the grandparent's contents
- **AND** the remaining text after the new last `/` SHALL be sent as `q`

#### Scenario: Paste full path
- **WHEN** the user pastes a full path like `/Users/robson/Project/pi-agent-dashboard`
- **THEN** PathPicker SHALL resolve the deepest valid directory
- **AND** display its contents in the list

#### Scenario: Empty directory
- **WHEN** the resolved directory has no subdirectories
- **THEN** the list SHALL show only `..` and a "No subdirectories" hint

#### Scenario: No filter matches
- **WHEN** the typed partial matches no entries
- **THEN** the list SHALL show `..`, a "No matches" hint, and the inline "Create \"&lt;partial&gt;\" here" row

#### Scenario: Loading state
- **WHEN** the PathPicker is fetching directory contents from the API
- **THEN** a loading indicator SHALL be shown in the list area

#### Scenario: Git repo indicator
- **WHEN** a directory entry has `isGit: true`
- **THEN** it SHALL show a visual git indicator

#### Scenario: Pi project indicator
- **WHEN** a directory entry has `isPi: true`
- **THEN** it SHALL show a visual pi indicator

### Requirement: PathPicker new folder creation
The `PathPicker` component SHALL let users create a new directory inside the currently-browsed parent directory via two affordances:
1. A footer **＋ New folder** button that opens an inline name-entry row at the top of the list.
2. An inline **＋ Create "<name>" here** row shown at the bottom of the list when the typed partial is non-empty AND no visible entry exactly matches the partial.

Both SHALL call `POST /api/browse/mkdir` with `{ parent: <currently-browsed directory>, name: <entered name> }`. On success the picker SHALL refresh the list and descend into the newly created directory (input becomes `<newPath>/`). On failure the server error SHALL be displayed inline in the existing error slot and the picker SHALL remain on the current directory.

#### Scenario: Inline create from typed partial
- **WHEN** the user types `new-thing` into the input, no existing entry matches exactly, and presses Enter while the "Create \"new-thing\" here" row is highlighted
- **THEN** the picker SHALL call `POST /api/browse/mkdir` with `parent` = the currently-browsed directory and `name="new-thing"`
- **AND** on success the input SHALL become `<parent>/new-thing/` and the list SHALL show the new (empty) directory's contents

#### Scenario: Footer New folder button
- **WHEN** the user clicks **＋ New folder** and types `experiments` then presses Enter
- **THEN** the picker SHALL call `POST /api/browse/mkdir` with `parent` = the currently-browsed directory and `name="experiments"`
- **AND** on success the input SHALL become `<parent>/experiments/` and the list SHALL show the new directory's contents

#### Scenario: Footer name entry cancelled
- **WHEN** the user opens the footer name entry and presses Escape
- **THEN** no directory SHALL be created
- **AND** focus SHALL return to the main input
- **AND** the inline name entry row SHALL close

#### Scenario: Create fails with existing name
- **WHEN** the server returns `{ success: false, error: "already exists" }`
- **THEN** the error SHALL be displayed in the PathPicker's error slot
- **AND** the input SHALL remain unchanged
- **AND** the picker SHALL NOT descend

#### Scenario: Create fails with invalid name
- **WHEN** the user enters a name containing `/` and submits
- **THEN** the server SHALL reject the request with `"invalid name"` and the error SHALL be shown inline
- **AND** no directory SHALL be created

#### Scenario: Inline create hidden on exact match
- **WHEN** the typed partial exactly matches an existing visible entry name (case-insensitive)
- **THEN** the inline "Create here" row SHALL NOT be shown
