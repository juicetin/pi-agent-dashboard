# Mid-turn Prompt Queue

## Purpose

Surface per-session pending-prompt state typed while the agent is mid-turn. Users compose steering and follow-up prompts during streaming; pi's native queues hold them, the bridge mirrors state via shadow queues, the server caches the snapshot from `queue_update` events, and the client renders the `PromptQueuePanel` above the chat input. Steering drains incrementally at `turn_end` boundaries; follow-up drains incrementally at `agent_end` boundaries — both per-entry by user `message_start` matcher.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Typed-during-streaming prompts are forwarded to pi's native queues

When the bridge receives a `send_prompt` message AND `getBridgeState().isAgentStreaming === true` for the target session AND the prompt is not a slash, bash, compact, reload, new, model, or mgmt command, the bridge SHALL route based on `msg.delivery` — follow-up goes to the bridge-owned buffer, steer goes to pi's queue:

- If `delivery === "followUp"` (or absent — backward-compat default), the bridge SHALL push the text into its in-memory `bridgeFollowUp: string[]` buffer AND emit `queue_update { sessionId, steering, followUp: [...bridgeFollowUp] }`. The bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.sendUserMessage(text, { deliverAs: "followUp" })`. Pi does not receive the message until the drain loop ships it later (see "Bridge follow-up drain loop runs on agent_end").

- If `delivery === "steer"`, the bridge SHALL call `pi.sendUserMessage(text, { deliverAs: "steer" })` directly. Steer remains pi-owned; the bridge tracks shadow steering via `recordSteerSent` + drain-by-`message_start`-matcher (unchanged from prior architecture).

The bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.clearSteeringQueue()`, `pi.clearFollowUpQueue()`, or `pi.clearAllQueues()` from any code path. None of these methods are exposed on pi's ExtensionAPI through pi 0.76.0.

When `getBridgeState().isAgentStreaming === false` (idle session), the bridge SHALL call `pi.sendUserMessage(text)` directly with no `deliverAs` option, starting a fresh turn. Idle sends bypass the buffer entirely (no chip appears).

#### Scenario: Follow-up send while streaming buffers in bridge
- **WHEN** the agent is streaming
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["original"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `send_prompt { text: "second", delivery: "followUp" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL push to `bridgeFollowUp`, making it `["original", "second"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { followUp: ["original", "second"] }`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.sendUserMessage` at all for this message

#### Scenario: Steer send during streaming routes to pi directly
- **WHEN** the agent is streaming
- **AND** the bridge receives `send_prompt { text: "focus on auth", delivery: "steer" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `pi.sendUserMessage("focus on auth", { deliverAs: "steer" })`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL push to `bridgeSteering` via `recordSteerSent`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update`

#### Scenario: Idle send bypasses the buffer
- **WHEN** the agent is idle
- **AND** the bridge receives `send_prompt { text: "hi" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `pi.sendUserMessage("hi")` with no `deliverAs`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT touch `bridgeFollowUp` or `bridgeSteering`

### Requirement: Protocol `send_prompt` messages carry optional delivery field

`SendPromptToExtensionMessage` and `SendPromptToBrowserMessage` SHALL include an optional `delivery?: "steer" | "followUp"` field. When absent, the receiver SHALL treat the message as `delivery: "followUp"`. The server SHALL pass `delivery` through transparently from browser → bridge without inspection or modification.

#### Scenario: delivery field survives server pass-through
- **WHEN** a browser sends `send_prompt { sessionId: "S", text: "hi", delivery: "steer" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL forward `send_prompt { type: "send_prompt", sessionId: "S", text: "hi", delivery: "steer" }` to the bridge

#### Scenario: Absent delivery field is preserved as absent
- **WHEN** a browser sends `send_prompt { sessionId: "S", text: "hi" }` without `delivery`
- **THEN** the server SHALL forward without `delivery`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL treat as followUp

### Requirement: Server caches per-session queue state from `queue_update` events

The server SHALL maintain a per-session `pendingQueues: { steering: string[]; followUp: string[] }` field inside `SessionUiState`. The field SHALL be updated whenever a `queue_update` ExtensionToServerMessage arrives from a bridge for that session. The server SHALL include `pendingQueues` in every `session_updated` broadcast and in the initial-state replay sent on browser subscribe.

This replaces the prior `queue.pending: PendingPrompt[]` cache, which was sourced from the deleted `queue_state` event.

#### Scenario: queue_update populates the cache
- **WHEN** a bridge sends `queue_update { sessionId: "S", steering: ["a", "b"], followUp: ["c"] }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `SessionUiState[S].pendingQueues = { steering: ["a", "b"], followUp: ["c"] }`
- **AND** the server SHALL broadcast `session_updated` with the new value to subscribers

#### Scenario: Empty arrays clear the cache slot
- **WHEN** a bridge sends `queue_update { sessionId: "S", steering: [], followUp: [] }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `SessionUiState[S].pendingQueues = { steering: [], followUp: [] }`
- **AND** the server SHALL broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Reconnect replays the cached state
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes to session "S" whose `pendingQueues` is non-empty
- **THEN** the initial-state snapshot SHALL include the current `pendingQueues` value
- **AND** the client SHALL render chips for both arrays without waiting for a fresh `queue_update`

### Requirement: Queue panel renders above the chat input

When `Session.queue.pending.length > 0` for the currently selected session, the chat view SHALL render a queue panel between the message list and the chat input. The panel SHALL list each queued message as a chip displaying the message text truncated to one line with overflow ellipsis. The panel SHALL include a "Clear all" affordance that, when clicked, sends a `clear_queue { sessionId }` message for the active session.

#### Scenario: Empty queue hides the panel
- **WHEN** `Session.queue.pending` is `[]`
- **THEN** the queue panel SHALL NOT be rendered

#### Scenario: Non-empty queue renders chips in insertion order
- **WHEN** `Session.queue.pending` is `[{id:"q1",text:"A"},{id:"q2",text:"B"},{id:"q3",text:"C"}]`
- **THEN** the queue panel SHALL render three chips in order: `A`, `B`, `C`

#### Scenario: Long message text truncates
- **WHEN** a queue chip's message text exceeds the chip's render width
- **THEN** the chip SHALL display the text with an ellipsis and SHALL NOT wrap to multiple lines

#### Scenario: Clear all sends clear_queue
- **WHEN** the user clicks the queue panel's "Clear all" button while subscribed to session S
- **THEN** the client SHALL send `clear_queue { type: "clear_queue", sessionId: "S" }` to the server

#### Scenario: Per-chip remove button sends remove_queue_entry
- **WHEN** the user clicks the X button on a chip whose entry id is `E` while subscribed to session S
- **THEN** the client SHALL send `remove_queue_entry { type: "remove_queue_entry", sessionId: "S", id: "E" }` to the server

#### Scenario: Each chip exposes a remove affordance
- **WHEN** the queue panel renders any chip
- **THEN** that chip SHALL include an X / remove button that, on click, invokes the per-entry remove flow

### Requirement: Client sends steer by default, followUp on modifier key

The command input SHALL send `delivery: "steer"` when the user presses Enter, and `delivery: "followUp"` when the user presses Alt+Enter (or Option+Enter on macOS). The send button click SHALL default to `delivery: "steer"`. This mirrors pi's TUI keyboard contract where Enter = steer and Alt+Enter = followUp.

The `PendingPrompt` in the client-side `SessionState` SHALL carry the `delivery` field so the optimistic chip can distinguish steering from follow-up visually.

#### Scenario: Enter sends steer
- **WHEN** the user types text and presses Enter
- **THEN** the client SHALL send `send_prompt { delivery: "steer", text, ... }`

#### Scenario: Alt+Enter sends followUp
- **WHEN** the user types text and presses Alt+Enter
- **THEN** the client SHALL send `send_prompt { delivery: "followUp", text, ... }`

#### Scenario: Send button defaults to steer
- **WHEN** the user clicks the send button
- **THEN** the client SHALL send `send_prompt { delivery: "steer", text, ... }`

#### Scenario: Optimistic chip shows delivery label
- **WHEN** `pendingPrompt.delivery === "steer"` and the chip is visible
- **THEN** the chip SHALL display a label indicating "steering" (or equivalent visual distinction)
- **WHEN** `pendingPrompt.delivery === "followUp"` and the chip is visible
- **THEN** the chip SHALL display a label indicating "follow-up"

### Requirement: Command input handles Alt+Enter distinct from Enter

The `CommandInput` component SHALL listen for `AltGraph + Enter` AND `Alt + Enter` key combinations, treating both as the follow-up send gesture. The existing `Enter` (unmodified) handler SHALL remain steer. Shift+Enter SHALL continue to insert a newline (existing behavior, unchanged).

#### Scenario: Alt+Enter sends followUp
- **WHEN** the user presses Alt+Enter (or Option+Enter on macOS) in the command input with text
- **THEN** the `onSend` callback SHALL be invoked with `delivery: "followUp"`

#### Scenario: Shift+Enter inserts newline (unchanged)
- **WHEN** the user presses Shift+Enter in the command input
- **THEN** a newline character SHALL be inserted and the cursor SHALL advance to the next line
- **AND** no send action SHALL fire

### Requirement: Image attachments are not displayed on chips in v1

Pi 0.74 receives image-bearing prompts via `pi.sendUserMessage(content, ...)` where `content` is an array of `TextContent | ImageContent`. The bridge holds the original `images` array on the `PendingPrompt`, but in v1 the queue chips SHALL render text only and SHALL NOT display image previews. When the user sends an image-bearing prompt that enters the bridge queue, the optimistic-prompt card SHALL still render with image thumbnails (per the existing `optimistic-prompt` capability) until that prompt is observed in the queue, at which point the card SHALL be replaced by a text-only chip and the image previews SHALL no longer be visible.

#### Scenario: Image-bearing send shows optimistic card with images, then text-only chip
- **WHEN** the user sends `{ text: "describe", images: [PNG] }` while the agent is streaming
- **THEN** initially an optimistic card SHALL render with the text and the PNG thumbnail
- **WHEN** the next `queue_state` event reports `pending: [{id:..., text:"describe", images:[PNG]}]`
- **THEN** the optimistic card SHALL be replaced by a text-only chip displaying "describe" with no image thumbnail

#### Scenario: Drain preserves image attachments
- **WHEN** the bridge drains a `PendingPrompt` that carries `images`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `pi.sendUserMessage` with the content array including the original images
- **AND** the resulting agent turn SHALL receive the images via pi's standard image handling

### Requirement: Session card shows a count-only queue indicator

When a session's `queue.pending.length > 0`, the session card in the session list SHALL display a small queue indicator showing the total count. The indicator SHALL NOT show queue contents — it is an at-a-glance signal only. When the count is zero, no indicator SHALL be rendered.

#### Scenario: Indicator appears when queue non-empty
- **WHEN** `Session.queue.pending` has 3 entries for a session
- **THEN** that session's card SHALL display a queue indicator with the count `3`

#### Scenario: Indicator hidden when queue empty
- **WHEN** `Session.queue.pending` is `[]` for a session
- **THEN** no queue indicator SHALL be rendered on that session's card

### Requirement: Queue render cap keeps the LATEST entries visible

The queue panel SHALL render at most 5 chips inline. If `pending.length > 5`, the panel SHALL render an overflow affordance reading "+N earlier" (where N is the hidden count) on the LEFT, followed by the LATEST 5 chips on the right (in insertion order within the visible window). The just-typed entry is therefore always visible as the rightmost chip; older entries collapse into the overflow indicator. The "+N earlier" affordance is read-only in v1; clicking it has no required action and MAY be made expandable later without protocol change.

#### Scenario: Queue of 4 renders all 4 chips
- **WHEN** `pending.length === 4`
- **THEN** the panel SHALL render 4 chips and SHALL NOT render an overflow affordance

#### Scenario: Queue of 8 renders "+3 earlier" on the LEFT plus the latest 5 chips
- **WHEN** `pending.length === 8` with entries `[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H]` (oldest first)
- **THEN** the panel SHALL render a single "+3 earlier" affordance followed by chips for `D, E, F, G, H` in that order
- **AND** the rightmost chip SHALL be `H` (the latest entry)

### Requirement: Client uses authoritative `pendingQueues`, no optimistic chip

The client SHALL NOT maintain an optimistic `pendingPrompt` slot when sending a prompt. Pending state SHALL be rendered exclusively from `state.pendingQueues`, populated via server-broadcast `queue_update` events.

`useSessionActions.handleSend` SHALL dispatch the `send_prompt` WS message and SHALL NOT mutate `state.pendingPrompt`. The `pendingPrompt` field and the `PendingPrompt` type SHALL be removed from `SessionState`.

#### Scenario: Send appears in panel only after queue_update
- **WHEN** the user sends a follow-up via Alt+Enter
- **THEN** no chip SHALL appear immediately
- **AND** when `queue_update` arrives with the new entry, the chip SHALL render

#### Scenario: No optimistic state to reconcile on bridge error
- **WHEN** the bridge fails to call `pi.sendUserMessage` (e.g., session ended mid-send)
- **THEN** no stale optimistic chip SHALL be visible
- **AND** the user retypes if they want to retry

### Requirement: Bridge maintains shadow steering and follow-up queues

Pi's ExtensionAPI does not forward `queue_update` events to extensions (verified through pi 0.76.0). The bridge SHALL maintain two distinct per-session in-memory structures with different ownership semantics:

- **`bridgeSteering: string[]` (pi-OWNED + SHADOW)** — mirrors pi's `Agent.steeringQueue`. Mutated only by `recordSteerSent` (on bridge-originated steer sends) + drain-by-`message_start`-matcher (when pi delivers a queued steer entry, the matching text is spliced).
- **`bridgeFollowUp: string[]` (BRIDGE-OWNED BUFFER)** — authoritative store for dashboard-originated follow-up entries while the agent is streaming. Pi never sees these entries until the drain loop ships them on `agent_end`. Mutated by `bufferFollowupSend` (on push) + `drainFollowupQueue` (on pop) + mutation handlers (`edit_followup_entry`, `remove_followup_entry`, `promote_followup_entry`, `clear_followup_entries`, `pull_followup_to_editor`).

Both structures feed the same `queue_update { sessionId, steering: [...], followUp: [...] }` ExtensionToServerMessage. The server caches the snapshot and broadcasts to subscribed browsers.

**Session-change reset:** session-change events (new / fork / resume) SHALL reset both arrays to `[]` and emit `queue_update` once. Different session — old state is meaningless.

**Bridge restart:** both structures are in-memory only; bridge process restart (`/reload`, dashboard restart, pi crash) loses them. Symmetric with pi's own queue behavior.

#### Scenario: Bridge records a steer mid-stream
- **WHEN** the agent is streaming
- **AND** the bridge sends `pi.sendUserMessage("focus on X", {deliverAs:"steer"})`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL append `"focus on X"` to `bridgeSteering`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { steering: [...], followUp: [...] }`

#### Scenario: Per-entry steering drain via message_start matcher
- **WHEN** `bridgeSteering` is `["a", "b", "c"]`
- **AND** pi drains `"a"` by emitting user `message_start` with content `"a"` at `turn_end`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL set `bridgeSteering` to `["b", "c"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update`

#### Scenario: Steering matcher checked before follow-up matcher
- **WHEN** `bridgeSteering` is `["hello"]` and `bridgeFollowUp` is `["hello"]`
- **AND** pi delivers user `message_start` with content `"hello"`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL remove the steering entry first (matches pi's emit order)
- **AND** `bridgeSteering` SHALL become `[]` while `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL still contain `["hello"]`

#### Scenario: Follow-up matcher is a no-op for buffered entries
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["queued by dashboard"]` (buffered, not yet drained)
- **AND** the agent finishes its turn and the drain loop pops `"queued by dashboard"` and sends it via `pi.sendUserMessage` with no `deliverAs`
- **AND** pi emits user `message_start` with content `"queued by dashboard"` for the fresh turn
- **THEN** the matcher SHALL look up `"queued by dashboard"` in `bridgeFollowUp` and find `-1` (already popped by the drain loop)
- **AND** the splice SHALL be a no-op; no `queue_update` emitted from the matcher path

#### Scenario: Session-change resets both structures
- **WHEN** the bridge handles `session_start` with `reason ∈ {"new", "fork", "resume"}`
- **AND** either `bridgeSteering` or `bridgeFollowUp` is non-empty
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL set both to `[]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { steering: [], followUp: [] }` once

### Requirement: Capture-before-send streaming gate prevents idle-message false-chip

Pi flips `isAgentStreaming` synchronously inside `pi.sendUserMessage` on an idle session (via `agent_start` emission to the extension runner). Therefore the bridge SHALL capture `wasStreaming = isAgentStreaming` **before** calling `pi.sendUserMessage`, and SHALL only record to the shadow queue when `wasStreaming === true`.

Call sites:

- `command-handler.ts` passthrough branch: capture before `sendUserMessageWithImages`, fire `onSteerSent` / `onFollowupSent` only if captured-true.
- `bridge.ts` `sessionPrompt` fallback (slash-route follow-up/steer): same pattern.
- `bridge.ts` `edit_followup_slot` / `edit_followup_entry` handler: same pattern.

The internal gate inside `recordSteerSent` / `recordFollowupSent` SHALL also check `isAgentStreaming` as defense-in-depth.

#### Scenario: Initial idle send produces no chip
- **WHEN** the agent is idle (`isAgentStreaming === false`)
- **AND** the bridge receives `send_prompt { text: "hello", delivery: "steer" }`
- **AND** pi flips `isAgentStreaming` to `true` synchronously inside `pi.sendUserMessage` (via agent_start)
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL NOT append to `bridgeSteering`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT emit `queue_update` with a chip
- **AND** the message SHALL be processed by pi as a fresh turn

#### Scenario: Mid-stream steer produces a chip
- **WHEN** `isAgentStreaming === true` at the moment of `send_prompt {delivery:"steer"}`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL append to `bridgeSteering`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update` with the new entry

### Requirement: Pending steer entries render inline in chat as user-style bubbles

The client SHALL render each entry of `Session.pendingQueues.steering[]` as a user-message-style bubble inside `ChatView`, positioned **at the bottom of the message list** (after the last assistant turn and any streaming text). Each rendered bubble SHALL:

- Use the same visual style as a real user message (`bg-blue-500/10 border border-blue-500/20 border-l-2 border-l-blue-400 rounded-xl shadow-md`).
- Display a `STEERING` header (uppercase, tertiary text) with an animated spinner.
- Disappear when `pendingQueues.steering[]` is empty (the bridge clears the shadow on `turn_end`). At that point pi's `message_end` will have already rendered the corresponding user message in chat, so the chat surface looks coherent.

The per-entry ✕ cancel button is REMOVED. Pi's `ExtensionAPI` (verified through pi 0.75.5) does NOT expose `clearSteeringQueue` or `clearFollowUpQueue`; the bridge's previous `(pi as any).clearSteeringQueue?.()` call was a silent no-op via the `typeof === "function"` guard. Clicking ✕ cleared the bridge shadow but pi still delivered the queued message at the next drain — a misleading UI. Until pi exposes queue mutation on `ExtensionContext`, the steer cards remain visible (so the user knows what's queued) but offer no cancel affordance.

The `QueuePanel.SteerSection` component SHALL be removed.

#### Scenario: Pending steer appears at the bottom of chat
- **WHEN** `Session.pendingQueues.steering` is `["focus on X"]`
- **AND** the message list ends with an assistant message
- **THEN** `ChatView` SHALL render "focus on X" as a user-style bubble after the assistant message, with `STEERING` header + spinner
- **AND** the bubble SHALL NOT render a ✕ cancel button

#### Scenario: Multiple pending steers render in order without cancel buttons
- **WHEN** `Session.pendingQueues.steering` is `["a", "b", "c"]`
- **THEN** `ChatView` SHALL render three bubbles in array order, all positioned at the bottom
- **AND** no `data-testid="pending-steer-cancel"` element SHALL be present in the DOM

#### Scenario: Steer chip disappears when shadow clears
- **WHEN** `Session.pendingQueues.steering` transitions from `["a"]` to `[]` (because pi emitted turn_end and the bridge per-entry drain matcher removed the entry)
- **THEN** the inline `STEERING` bubble SHALL disappear
- **AND** the chat SHALL show "a" as a real user message once pi emits `message_end` for that user message

#### Scenario: Bridge `clear_steering_queue` handler still clears shadow (for stale clients)
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `clear_steering_queue { sessionId }` (e.g. from a stale client that still has the ✕ button)
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL set `bridgeSteering = []`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { steering: [], followUp: <unchanged> }`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT log a warning about the missing pi method (silent no-op)
- **AND** pi's internal `_steeringMessages` queue SHALL still deliver at the next drain (known limitation — see upstream pi feature request)

### Requirement: Follow-up queue surface is display-only with cycling navigation

The client `QueuePanel` component SHALL render the follow-up queue as a display-only surface. One entry visible at a time, navigable with two controls only:

- **↑ Previous (`queue-followup-prev`)** — navigate to previous entry in `pendingQueues.followUp[]`. Disabled when `currentIndex === 0`. Hidden when queue has ≤1 entry.
- **↓ Next (`queue-followup-next`)** — navigate to next entry. Disabled when at last entry. Hidden when queue has ≤1 entry.
- Position indicator (`queue-followup-position`) shows `“<idx+1> of <total>”` when queue has ≥2 entries.

The visible entry SHALL be rendered as plain text inside `data-testid="queue-chip-followup"`. **NO mutation controls SHALL be present**: no ✕ cancel-all, no ✕ per-entry remove, no edit (click-to-edit), no ⇧ promote, no editor textarea. The following `data-testid` values SHALL NEVER be in the DOM:

- `queue-followup-promote`
- `queue-followup-remove`
- `queue-followup-edit`
- `queue-followup-editor`

Navigation between entries is purely client-side state (no network round-trip, no bridge messages, no pi mutation). The currentIndex SHALL clamp to `length - 1` when the queue shrinks and SHALL jump to `length - 1` when the queue grows (append-friendly UX so the user sees what they just queued).

Rationale: pi's ExtensionAPI (verified through pi 0.75.5) exposes no queue mutation methods. The bridge's previous `(pi as any).clearFollowUpQueue?.()` was a silent no-op; per-entry edit/promote/remove all routed through `rewriteFollowupQueue` which appended duplicates instead of replacing. The honest interim UX matches pi-TUI's own model: `app.message.dequeue` (`alt+up`) yanks ALL queued text into the editor; per-entry editing doesn't exist there either. The dashboard's Stop button (`wrappedHandleAbort`) already implements the yank-into-draft side of that flow.

Upstream pi feature request: expose `ctx.clearQueue()` on `ExtensionContext` (one-liner over `AgentSession.clearQueue()`); once available, restore the mutation surface honestly.

#### Scenario: empty queue renders nothing
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `[]`
- **THEN** the `QueuePanel` SHALL render nothing in the DOM

#### Scenario: single entry renders text + no controls
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `["only one"]`
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL contain `"only one"`
- **AND** no `queue-followup-prev`, `queue-followup-next`, `queue-followup-promote`, `queue-followup-remove`, `queue-followup-edit`, `queue-followup-editor`, OR `queue-followup-position` element SHALL be present

#### Scenario: multi-entry renders cycling controls + position indicator
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]`
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL initially render `"gamma"` (the last entry)
- **AND** `queue-followup-position` SHALL render `"3 of 3"`
- **AND** `queue-followup-prev` and `queue-followup-next` SHALL be present
- **AND** `queue-followup-promote`, `queue-followup-remove`, `queue-followup-edit`, `queue-followup-editor` SHALL NOT be present

#### Scenario: ↑ navigates without mutating the queue
- **GIVEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]` (currentIndex = 2)
- **WHEN** the user clicks `queue-followup-prev`
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL render `"beta"`
- **AND** NO browser-to-server message SHALL be dispatched (no `clear_followup_slot`, no `edit_followup_entry`, no `remove_followup_entry`, no `promote_followup_entry`)
- **AND** `pendingQueues.followUp` SHALL remain `["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]`

#### Scenario: navigation buttons disable at boundaries
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `["a", "b"]` and currentIndex is at the last entry
- **THEN** `queue-followup-next` SHALL be disabled (`disabled` attribute)
- **WHEN** the user clicks `queue-followup-prev` to navigate to currentIndex 0
- **THEN** `queue-followup-prev` SHALL be disabled

#### Scenario: currentIndex clamps when the queue shrinks
- **GIVEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` was `["a", "b", "c"]` (currentIndex = 2)
- **WHEN** a `queue_update` arrives with `followUp: ["a", "b"]` (length decreased)
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL render `"b"` (clamped to last valid index)

#### Scenario: currentIndex jumps to last on grow (append-friendly)
- **GIVEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` was `["a"]`
- **WHEN** a `queue_update` arrives with `followUp: ["a", "b"]` (length increased)
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL render `"b"` (the newly-appended entry)

### Requirement: User abort resets shadow queues and clears pi's native queues

When the bridge's `abort` extension command is invoked (via a browser `abort { sessionId }` message routed through the server to pi), the bridge SHALL — before invoking `cachedCtx.abort()` — perform the same shadow-queue reset used by the shutdown command:

1. The bridge SHALL call `pi.clearSteeringQueue()` and `pi.clearFollowUpQueue()` defensively (guarded by `typeof === "function"` and wrapped in `try/catch`). Both run unconditionally.
2. If either `bridgeSteering` or `bridgeFollowUp` is non-empty, the bridge SHALL reset both to `[]` AND emit one final `queue_update { sessionId, steering: [], followUp: [] }`. Empty shadows SHALL NOT emit `queue_update`.
3. The bridge SHALL THEN invoke the existing `cachedCtx.abort()` call.
4. After `cachedCtx.abort()`, the bridge SHALL call `retryTracker.noteAbort(sessionId)` (clears the in-flight attempt counter). The bridge SHALL NOT call `usageLimitOrderer.noteRetryEnd(sessionId)`; the orderer's `pending` flag MUST survive user-initiated abort so that pi's eventual terminal `agent_end` can still surface the real provider `errorMessage` via the orderer's `maybeSynthesize` path.

The wrapper-abort SHALL run exactly ONCE on the initial `abort` command. Subsequent persistent-abort scheduler ticks (see `provider-retry-state` "Bridge persistent-abort scheduler closes retry race") SHALL invoke `cachedCtx.abort()` directly (raw), NOT the wrapper — preventing recurring queue clears that would clobber user prompts sent within the 2 s persistent-abort window.

Rationale: user clicked Stop. Mental model is "stop everything currently queued" — queued messages must not be delivered after the abort settles. Matches pi-TUI's `restoreQueuedMessagesToEditor({abort: true})` behavior. The orderer's pending flag is intentionally NOT cleared here so that the real provider error survives the user-initiated abort path.

#### Scenario: Abort with non-empty steering resets, emits, then calls cachedCtx.abort
- **WHEN** `bridgeSteering` is `["focus on X"]` and `bridgeFollowUp` is `[]`
- **AND** the bridge's `abort` extension command is invoked
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `pi.clearSteeringQueue()` and `pi.clearFollowUpQueue()` defensively
- **AND** the bridge SHALL set `bridgeSteering` to `[]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { sessionId, steering: [], followUp: [] }` exactly once
- **AND** the bridge SHALL THEN invoke `cachedCtx.abort()`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL call `retryTracker.noteAbort(sessionId)`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT call `usageLimitOrderer.noteRetryEnd(sessionId)`

#### Scenario: Abort with both queues empty does NOT emit queue_update
- **WHEN** `bridgeSteering` is `[]` and `bridgeFollowUp` is `[]`
- **AND** the bridge's `abort` extension command is invoked
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL still call `pi.clearSteeringQueue()` and `pi.clearFollowUpQueue()` defensively
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT emit `queue_update`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL invoke `cachedCtx.abort()` as before
- **AND** `usageLimitOrderer.hasPending(sessionId)` SHALL be unchanged by the abort

#### Scenario: Pi missing clear-queue functions — abort still proceeds without throw
- **WHEN** the running pi version does not expose `pi.clearSteeringQueue` as a function
- **AND** the bridge's `abort` extension command is invoked with non-empty shadows
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL skip the missing call (guarded by `typeof === "function"`)
- **AND** the bridge SHALL still reset the shadow arrays and emit the final `queue_update`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL still invoke `cachedCtx.abort()`

#### Scenario: Wrapper-abort runs once, persistent ticks run raw
- **WHEN** the user dispatches `abort` for a session with `bridgeSteering: ["a"]`
- **THEN** the wrapper-abort body (clear queues, reset shadows, emit queue_update, cachedCtx.abort, noteAbort) SHALL execute exactly once
- **AND** subsequent persistent-abort scheduler ticks within the 2 s window SHALL each invoke `cachedCtx.abort()` directly
- **AND** the persistent ticks SHALL NOT additionally call `pi.clearSteeringQueue`, `pi.clearFollowUpQueue`, reset bridge shadows, or emit `queue_update`

#### Scenario: Orderer pending survives user abort during retry
- **GIVEN** the orderer's `pending` flag is `true` for the session (retry chain in flight)
- **WHEN** the user dispatches `abort`
- **THEN** the wrapper-abort SHALL run as described above
- **AND** `usageLimitOrderer.hasPending(sessionId)` SHALL remain `true` after the wrapper completes
- **AND** when pi subsequently emits `agent_end` with `errorMessage` matching `USAGE_LIMIT_PATTERN`, the orderer's `maybeSynthesize` SHALL fire and forward the synthesized terminal `auto_retry_end{finalError}` carrying the real provider message

### Requirement: rewriteFollowupQueue requires active streaming

The bridge's `rewriteFollowupQueue(newEntries)` helper — used by `edit_followup_slot`, `edit_followup_entry`, `promote_followup_entry`, and `remove_followup_entry` message handlers — SHALL early-return when `getBridgeState().isAgentStreaming === false`. The helper SHALL emit a `command_feedback` event with `status: "error"` and a human-readable message (e.g. `"Follow-up queue edit ignored: session is idle"`) so the client can surface a transient toast and clear the affected chip from the visible queue.

Rationale: pi's `pi.sendUserMessage(text, {deliverAs:"followUp"})` is idle-aware — when there is no streaming agent, pi treats the call as a fresh user send and synchronously fires `agent_start`, starting a NEW turn for the first replayed entry. Without this guard, an edit/promote/remove against an idle session would refire the agent for the first replayed entry while the bridge's shadow simultaneously claims the entries are queued — a desync that surfaces as "the agent started running my queued message instead of waiting".

The guard SHALL apply equally to all four entry points (`edit_followup_slot`, `edit_followup_entry`, `promote_followup_entry`, `remove_followup_entry`). Each handler SHALL check `isAgentStreaming` BEFORE calling `rewriteFollowupQueue` (or inside, identically — implementation choice as long as the no-op behavior is observable from outside).

When the guard fires, the bridge's shadow queue (`bridgeFollowUp`) SHALL remain unchanged AND no `queue_update` SHALL be emitted. The user-visible queue stays at whatever state it was before the user clicked the control. The `command_feedback` is the only outgoing event.

#### Scenario: edit_followup_entry on idle session emits command_feedback and does not refire
- **GIVEN** `isAgentStreaming === false` (no active agent)
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b"]`
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `edit_followup_entry { sessionId, index: 1, text: "b-edited" }`
- **THEN** `pi.sendUserMessage` SHALL NOT be invoked
- **AND** `pi.clearFollowUpQueue` SHALL NOT be invoked
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `["a", "b"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL forward a `command_feedback { status: "error", message: <user-facing string> }` event
- **AND** no `queue_update` SHALL be emitted

#### Scenario: promote_followup_entry on idle session is a no-op with feedback
- **GIVEN** `isAgentStreaming === false`
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b", "c"]`
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `promote_followup_entry { sessionId, index: 2 }`
- **THEN** `pi.sendUserMessage` SHALL NOT be invoked
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `["a", "b", "c"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL forward `command_feedback { status: "error", … }`

#### Scenario: remove_followup_entry on idle session is a no-op with feedback
- **GIVEN** `isAgentStreaming === false`
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b"]`
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `remove_followup_entry { sessionId, index: 0 }`
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `["a", "b"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL forward `command_feedback { status: "error", … }`

#### Scenario: edit_followup_entry while streaming behaves as today
- **GIVEN** `isAgentStreaming === true`
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b"]`
- **WHEN** the bridge receives `edit_followup_entry { sessionId, index: 1, text: "b-edited" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL invoke `pi.clearFollowUpQueue()`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL invoke `pi.sendUserMessage("a", { deliverAs: "followUp" })`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL invoke `pi.sendUserMessage("b-edited", { deliverAs: "followUp" })`
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL be `["a", "b-edited"]`
- **AND** a `queue_update` SHALL be emitted

#### Scenario: rewriteFollowupQueue is no-op when post-abort idle
- **GIVEN** the user dispatched `abort` (wrapper-abort ran, `bridgeFollowUp` is `[]`, `isAgentStreaming` is `false` after agent_end settled)
- **WHEN** any of the four follow-up-mutation messages arrives at the bridge (e.g. due to a race between the abort and the user clicking ✕ on a chip still visible in the client)
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL early-return per `isAgentStreaming === false`
- **AND** no `pi.sendUserMessage` SHALL fire (no agent refire)
- **AND** the bounds check on `bridgeFollowUp` length would also have caught this (length 0), but the streaming-guard is sufficient on its own

### Requirement: Follow-up send appends to the queue (v2 replace of v1 send-while-occupied semantics)

When the user presses Alt+Enter (or equivalent send-with-followup gesture), the client SHALL dispatch `send_prompt { delivery: "followUp", text }`. The bridge SHALL append the new entry to `bridgeFollowUp[]` (never replace existing entries). The client SHALL update `currentIndex` to point at the newly-appended entry.

#### Scenario: Send while buffer non-empty appends
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `["a", "b"]`
- **AND** the user types "c" + Alt+Enter
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL append "c" to `bridgeFollowUp`
- **AND** the next `queue_update` SHALL show `followUp: ["a", "b", "c"]`
- **AND** the client SHALL set `currentIndex` to 2

#### Scenario: Send while buffer empty initializes
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` is `[]`
- **AND** the user types "first" + Alt+Enter
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL set `bridgeFollowUp` to `["first"]`
- **AND** the next `queue_update` SHALL show `followUp: ["first"]`
- **AND** `currentIndex` SHALL be 0

#### Scenario: Soft cap on buffer depth
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp.length === 20` (soft cap)
- **AND** the user attempts to send another follow-up
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL reject the new entry (drop with warn log, or emit `command_feedback { status: "error" }` — implementation choice)
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain at length 20

### Requirement: Drained queued user message renders AFTER the preceding assistant message in chat

When pi drains a queued user message at either boundary (steer at `turn_end`, follow-up at `agent_end`), the resulting user `message_start` event SHALL arrive on the wire AFTER the preceding assistant `message_end` event for the same turn. The client reducer SHALL therefore append the drained user bubble to `state.messages[]` AFTER the assistant's final response, not before it.

This invariant applies to BOTH drain boundaries:

- **Steer drain** at `turn_end` (Enter while streaming)
- **Follow-up drain** at `agent_end` (Alt+Enter while streaming)

At either boundary pi emits four events synchronously back-to-back in this order:

1. `message_end` (assistant — the final response of the just-completed turn)
2. `turn_end` OR `agent_end` (the drain boundary)
3. `message_start` (user — the drained steer or follow-up text)
4. `message_end` (user — same text)

The bridge defers every `message_end` send via `setTimeout(0)` for entryId capture (per `fix-per-message-fork`). To preserve pi's emit order on the wire, the bridge SHALL also defer USER `message_start` sends via the same `setTimeout(0)` so they queue in the timer FIFO behind any pending `message_end` deferrals. The check is on `messageRef.role === "user"` — it does NOT discriminate by drain source (steer / follow-up / fresh send all funnel through the same code path).

The bridge SHALL NOT defer ASSISTANT `message_start` sends — `message_update` events fire synchronously and the reducer's `streamingTextFlushed` reset depends on the assistant `message_start` being processed first.

#### Scenario: Drained STEER appears below the assistant's final response
- **WHEN** the agent is mid-turn streaming `"weather report"`
- **AND** the user types `"asd"` and presses Enter (delivery=steer)
- **AND** the assistant finishes the current turn
- **AND** pi drains the steer at `turn_end`, delivering `"asd"` as a new user message
- **THEN** the wire order received by the client SHALL be: `turn_end`, `message_end` (assistant `"weather report"`), `message_start` (user `"asd"`), `message_end` (user `"asd"`)
- **AND** the client SHALL render `"weather report"` (assistant bubble) ABOVE `"asd"` (user bubble) in the chat

#### Scenario: Drained FOLLOW-UP appears below the assistant's final response
- **WHEN** the agent is mid-turn streaming `"weather report"`
- **AND** the user types `"asd"` and presses Alt+Enter (delivery=followUp)
- **AND** the assistant finishes the entire agent run
- **AND** pi drains the follow-up at `agent_end`, delivering `"asd"` as a new user message
- **THEN** the wire order received by the client SHALL be: `agent_end`, `message_end` (assistant `"weather report"`), `message_start` (user `"asd"`), `message_end` (user `"asd"`)
- **AND** the client SHALL render `"weather report"` (assistant bubble) ABOVE `"asd"` (user bubble) in the chat

#### Scenario: Bridge defers USER message_start, sends ASSISTANT message_start sync
- **WHEN** the bridge handles a `message_start` event
- **AND** the message's `role` is `"user"`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL queue the `connection.send` via `setTimeout(0)`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL keep `wrapAppendMessageForCtx` + `pendingNonces.set` synchronous (state mutations must run sync before the handler returns)
- **WHEN** the bridge handles a `message_start` event
- **AND** the message's `role` is `"assistant"`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `connection.send` synchronously (so subsequent `message_update` events arrive after the reducer has processed `message_start` and reset `streamingTextFlushed`)

#### Scenario: Multiple drained entries preserve their pi emit order
- **WHEN** a queue contains `["a", "b"]` at the drain boundary (steer or follow-up)
- **AND** pi drains both entries in order
- **THEN** the wire order SHALL be: assistant `message_end`, user `message_start "a"`, user `message_end "a"`, user `message_start "b"`, user `message_end "b"`
- **AND** the chat SHALL render the assistant message first, then `"a"`, then `"b"`

#### Scenario: Idle user send is unaffected by the deferral
- **WHEN** the user sends a prompt on an idle session
- **AND** no `message_end` is pending in the timer queue
- **THEN** the user `message_start` SHALL still be deferred via `setTimeout(0)` (uniform handling)
- **AND** the message SHALL appear in chat after exactly one macrotask delay (visually instant)

### Requirement: Bridge follow-up drain loop runs on agent_end with pop-before-send invariant

The bridge SHALL subscribe to pi's `agent_end` event and schedule `drainFollowupQueue()` via `setTimeout(_, 0)` (NOT `queueMicrotask`). The setTimeout is required to escape pi's run lifecycle: pi emits `agent_end` to extensions INSIDE the executor body of `runWithLifecycle`, but pi's `finishRun()` (which flips `isStreaming=false` and clears `activeRun`) only runs in the `finally` block AFTER the executor returns. A microtask runs before that finally; a setTimeout runs after. (Verified at pi-coding-agent `pi-agent-core/agent.js:307-330` for pi 0.76.0.)

The drain function SHALL enforce the following invariants in order:

1. **Re-entrancy lock**: a boolean `isDraining` SHALL prevent overlapping drain frames. Set true after gates pass; cleared in `finally`. Re-entrant calls early-return.
2. **Empty-buffer gate**: if `bridgeFollowUp.length === 0`, drain bails immediately. No-op.
3. **TUI-coexistence gate**: if `ctx.hasPendingMessages()` returns true (pi's own queue still has TUI-sent items), drain bails. The method lives on `ctx` (verified at pi 0.76.0 `extensions/types.d.ts:227`) and SHALL be guarded by `typeof === "function"` for older pi.
4. **Idle retry gate**: if `ctx.isIdle()` returns false (pi still in transition window post-agent_end), drain SHALL re-schedule itself via `setTimeout(..., 100)` with a bounded retry counter (max ~20 retries / 2s). After the cap, drain logs a warning and gives up. NOTE: an earlier design draft (D2 v1) gated on `isIdle()` and bailed immediately on false; smoke testing showed this blocks drain entirely because pi's `finishRun()` hasn't flipped state yet at scheduling time.
5. **Pop FIRST**: `bridgeFollowUp.shift()` captures the front entry BEFORE any pi call. The entry exists only on the call stack from this point.
6. **Emit BEFORE send**: `emitQueueUpdate()` SHALL fire reflecting the popped state BEFORE calling pi. Wire-state matches buffer-state at all observable moments.
7. **Fresh-turn send, NO deliverAs**: `pi.sendUserMessage(entry)` is called with NO options. Pi is now idle (passed the gate), so pi starts a new run via `Agent.prompt()`. NOTE: an earlier draft (D2 v2) tried `{ deliverAs: "followUp" }` to handle the transition window; smoke testing showed pi accepts the message into `Agent.followUpQueue` but its `getFollowUpMessages()` callback (called only inside `runAgentLoop`) has already exited — the queued entry never drains. Hence the strict requirement: wait for true idle, then fresh-turn send.
8. **Catch + drop on pi error**: any synchronous exception from `pi.sendUserMessage` SHALL be caught, logged as `console.warn`, and the entry SHALL be considered lost. The bridge SHALL NOT re-push.

The drain SHALL handle at most one entry per `agent_end`. Multiple queued entries drain across multiple agent turns in FIFO order (each turn fires its own `agent_end` which re-invokes the drain for the next entry).

#### Scenario: agent_end drains one entry, leaves the rest
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b", "c"]`
- **AND** `ctx.isIdle()` returns true AND `ctx.hasPendingMessages()` returns false
- **AND** `agent_end` event fires
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL `shift` "a" from `bridgeFollowUp`, leaving `["b", "c"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { followUp: ["b", "c"] }`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL call `pi.sendUserMessage("a")` with NO deliverAs option
- **AND** the bridge SHALL return without touching "b" or "c"

#### Scenario: Pop is observable BEFORE the pi.sendUserMessage call
- **WHEN** Vitest spies record the order of `bridgeFollowUp.shift` and `pi.sendUserMessage` calls
- **THEN** the `shift` call SHALL appear in the call log BEFORE the `sendUserMessage` call

#### Scenario: pi.sendUserMessage throws — entry is lost, not re-queued
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a"]`
- **AND** `pi.sendUserMessage` throws synchronously
- **AND** `agent_end` fires triggering drain
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL log a warning containing "drainFollowupQueue" and "entry lost"
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `[]` (the entry is NOT re-pushed)
- **AND** the next `agent_end` SHALL find an empty buffer and no-op

#### Scenario: Idle retry succeeds within bounded window
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a"]`
- **AND** `agent_end` fires while `ctx.isIdle()` still returns false (transition window)
- **THEN** the drain SHALL schedule itself via `setTimeout(_, 100)` and retry
- **AND** the buffer SHALL remain `["a"]` during the retry window
- **AND** within ~2s (20 retries), `ctx.isIdle()` SHALL return true and the drain SHALL proceed

#### Scenario: Idle retry exhausts bounded window
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a"]`
- **AND** `ctx.isIdle()` continues to return false for >2s after `agent_end`
- **THEN** the drain SHALL log `"drainFollowupQueue: pi never idled after 2s; giving up"`
- **AND** the entry SHALL remain in `bridgeFollowUp` (visible to user; next agent_end will retry)

#### Scenario: TUI coexistence — bridge waits for pi to drain its own queue first
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["dashboard-msg"]`
- **AND** `pi.hasPendingMessages()` returns true (TUI-queued follow-up still pending in pi)
- **AND** `agent_end` fires
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL NOT drain its own buffer
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `["dashboard-msg"]`
- **AND** on a subsequent `agent_end` after pi has drained, `hasPendingMessages()` returns false and the bridge drains "dashboard-msg"

#### Scenario: Re-entrancy lock prevents double-drain
- **WHEN** the drain function is mid-execution for entry "a"
- **AND** a second `agent_end` event fires synchronously (re-entrant)
- **THEN** the second invocation SHALL early-return without popping
- **AND** the original drain SHALL complete normally
- **AND** a subsequent non-re-entrant `agent_end` SHALL drain "b"

### Requirement: Per-entry follow-up mutation mutates ONLY the bridge buffer

The bridge SHALL accept the following browser-to-server messages and mutate `bridgeFollowUp` locally + emit `queue_update`. The bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.sendUserMessage`, `pi.clear*Queue`, or any other pi method as part of handling these messages:

- `edit_followup_entry { sessionId, index, text, images? }` — replaces `bridgeFollowUp[index]`.
- `remove_followup_entry { sessionId, index }` — splices `bridgeFollowUp[index]`.
- `promote_followup_entry { sessionId, index }` — moves `bridgeFollowUp[index]` to position 0 via splice + unshift. Silent no-op when `index <= 0`.
- `clear_followup_entries { sessionId, indices }` — splices selected entries (when `indices: number[]`, sorted descending to avoid index drift) OR empties the buffer (when `indices: "all"`).

Out-of-range indices SHALL cause the handler to emit `command_feedback { command: <type>, status: "error", message: "Index out of range" }`. No partial mutation occurs.

#### Scenario: Edit mutates buffer only, never touches pi
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `edit_followup_entry { index: 1, text: "BETA" }`
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL become `["alpha", "BETA", "gamma"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { followUp: ["alpha", "BETA", "gamma"] }`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.sendUserMessage`, `pi.clearSteeringQueue`, `pi.clearFollowUpQueue`, or any other pi method

#### Scenario: Remove splices a single entry
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `remove_followup_entry { index: 0 }`
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL become `["beta", "gamma"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update`

#### Scenario: Promote moves entry to head
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `promote_followup_entry { index: 2 }`
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL become `["gamma", "alpha", "beta"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update`

#### Scenario: Promote on index 0 is a silent no-op
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["alpha", "beta"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `promote_followup_entry { index: 0 }`
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `["alpha", "beta"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT emit `queue_update`

#### Scenario: Clear all empties the buffer
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b", "c"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `clear_followup_entries { indices: "all" }`
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL become `[]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update { followUp: [] }`

#### Scenario: Clear specific indices splices selected entries
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `clear_followup_entries { indices: [0, 2] }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL splice in descending order (2 first, then 0) to avoid index drift
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL become `["b", "d"]`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `queue_update` exactly once

#### Scenario: Out-of-range index produces command_feedback error
- **WHEN** `bridgeFollowUp` is `["a"]`
- **AND** the bridge receives `edit_followup_entry { index: 5, text: "x" }`
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL NOT mutate `bridgeFollowUp`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL emit `command_feedback { command: "edit_followup_entry", status: "error", message: "Index out of range" }`
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT emit `queue_update`

### Requirement: TUI compatibility — dashboard-buffered follow-up is invisible to TUI; symmetric

The dashboard's bridge SHALL hold dashboard-originated follow-up entries exclusively in `bridgeFollowUp`, never mirroring them into pi's `Agent.followUpQueue` until the drain loop ships them. Therefore:

1. TUI users SHALL NOT see dashboard-queued follow-ups in pi-TUI's footer widget (pi has no knowledge of the bridge buffer).
2. TUI users pressing `alt+up` (which calls `agent.clearAllQueues()`) SHALL clear pi's queues only; `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain untouched.
3. Dashboard users SHALL NOT see TUI-queued follow-ups in the dashboard `QueuePanel` (the shadow only tracks bridge-originated sends).
4. Both surfaces' messages SHALL still execute. At each `agent_end`, pi drains its own queue first (TUI items); the bridge drain runs after via the TUI-coexistence gate (`hasPendingMessages` returning false).

The bridge buffer is in-memory and SHALL NOT persist across bridge restart. On `/reload`, dashboard restart, or pi crash, `bridgeFollowUp` initializes empty; any pending dashboard-queued items are lost.

#### Scenario: Mixed TUI + dashboard queue — both drain in order
- **WHEN** TUI sends follow-up "look at logs" via `pi.sendUserMessage(_, {deliverAs:"followUp"})` (enters pi's queue)
- **AND** dashboard sends follow-up "run tests" (enters `bridgeFollowUp`)
- **AND** the agent finishes its current turn, firing `agent_end`
- **THEN** pi SHALL drain its own queue first — "look at logs" runs as a continuation turn
- **AND** a subsequent `agent_end` fires after that turn
- **AND** `pi.hasPendingMessages()` now returns false; the bridge drain fires `pi.sendUserMessage("run tests")` for the dashboard item
- **AND** both messages execute in order: TUI item first, dashboard item second

#### Scenario: TUI alt+up does not clear dashboard buffer
- **WHEN** TUI has queued "X" in pi's queue
- **AND** dashboard has buffered "Y" in `bridgeFollowUp`
- **AND** the TUI user presses alt+up
- **THEN** `pi.Agent.followUpQueue` SHALL be cleared (text "X" returns to TUI editor)
- **AND** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL remain `["Y"]`
- **AND** the dashboard `QueuePanel` SHALL continue showing "Y"

#### Scenario: Bridge restart loses bridgeFollowUp
- **WHEN** dashboard has buffered "important task" in `bridgeFollowUp`
- **AND** the bridge process restarts (e.g. `/reload`)
- **THEN** `bridgeFollowUp` SHALL initialize to `[]` on the new bridge instance
- **AND** "important task" SHALL be lost (user must re-type)
- **AND** the QueuePanel SHALL render nothing for that session until the user re-queues

### Requirement: Steer queue is permanently pi-owned + display-only — no bridge-owned-steer

The steer queue SHALL remain pi-owned for the indefinite future. The dashboard SHALL NOT introduce a bridge-owned steer buffer, steer mutation surface, or per-steer-entry edit/remove/promote/pull affordances. Steer entries render inline in `ChatView` as ghost user-message bubbles (not in the follow-up `QueuePanel`).

**Rationale**: Steer drains every 1-15 seconds at every `turn_end`. The window in which a user could meaningfully cancel/edit a steer entry is too short to justify the UI surface. Pi-TUI also has no per-steer edit. This is a permanent design decision, not a tracked future change.

The bridge SHALL track `bridgeSteering` as a SHADOW (mirrors pi's `Agent.steeringQueue`) via:

- `recordSteerSent(text)`: bridge-originated steer pushes append to `bridgeSteering` only when `getBridgeState().isAgentStreaming === true` (capture-before-send pattern; mid-flight `pi.sendUserMessage` flips `isAgentStreaming` synchronously on idle sends, so we capture pre-send to avoid false chips).
- Drain-by-`message_start`-matcher: when pi delivers a queued steer at `turn_end`, the matching text is spliced from `bridgeSteering` (FIFO first-occurrence removal).

The dashboard SHALL NOT expose any client-side action that mutates `bridgeSteering` or pi's steer queue. The Stop button calls `cachedCtx.abort()` only — pi's steer queue persists across abort by design.

#### Scenario: No steer mutation messages exist in the wire protocol
- **WHEN** the wire protocol (`packages/shared/src/browser-protocol.ts`) is examined for steer-mutation message types
- **THEN** there SHALL be no `clear_steering_queue`, `edit_steering_entry`, `remove_steering_entry`, or `promote_steering_entry` types
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT handle any such messages

#### Scenario: Steer renders inline as ghost bubbles, never in QueuePanel
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.steering` is `["focus on X"]`
- **THEN** `ChatView` SHALL render "focus on X" as a ghost user-message bubble at the bottom of the message list with a STEERING header + animated spinner
- **AND** `QueuePanel` SHALL NOT render any steer chip or steer section

#### Scenario: Stop does NOT clear pi's steer queue
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.steering` is `["a", "b"]`
- **AND** the user clicks Stop
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL call `cachedCtx.abort()` only
- **AND** the bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.clearSteeringQueue` (it's not on the ExtensionAPI; the call is deleted from this codebase)
- **AND** pi's steer queue SHALL persist; the entries will drain at the next `turn_end` of the next turn (when the user re-prompts)

### Requirement: Pi ExtensionAPI does not expose queue-mutation methods

The bridge SHALL NOT call `pi.clearSteeringQueue()`, `pi.clearFollowUpQueue()`, or `pi.clearAllQueues()` from any code path. These methods exist on the inner `pi-agent-core` Agent class but are NOT exposed on the ExtensionAPI handed to extensions (verified through pi-coding-agent 0.76.0 at `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:1076-1099`).

If a future pi release adds these methods to the ExtensionAPI, a separate change MAY OPTIONALLY introduce them as an optimization (e.g. "explicit flush of TUI items before bridge drain"). The dashboard's correctness SHALL NOT depend on their availability; the bridge-owned model is correct without them.

#### Scenario: Codebase contains no `pi.clear*Queue` call expressions
- **WHEN** `grep -nE 'pi\.clearFollowUpQueue\(|pi\.clearSteeringQueue\(|pi\.clearAllQueues\(' packages/extension/src` runs
- **THEN** the output SHALL contain zero call expressions (only comment markers that reference the deletion are acceptable)

#### Scenario: Bridge ignores the OLD deleted browser message types
- **WHEN** the bridge receives any of: `clear_steering_queue`, `clear_followup_slot`, `edit_followup_slot`, `edit_followup_entry` (with the OLD pi-mutation semantics), `remove_followup_entry` (with the OLD semantics), `promote_followup_entry` (with the OLD semantics)
- **AND** these arrive through a stale client or test injection
- **THEN** the bridge router SHALL NOT have a `case` arm for any of them
- **AND** the message SHALL be silently dropped (fall through to the default no-op arm)
- **AND** no `pi.*` method SHALL be called
- **AND** no `queue_update` SHALL be emitted
- **NOTE**: `edit_followup_entry`, `remove_followup_entry`, `promote_followup_entry` are RE-INTRODUCED with NEW bridge-buffer-only semantics in the ADDED requirements above. The negative-assertion test (`bridge-no-queue-mutation.test.ts`) MUST iterate only the names that remain permanently deleted: `clear_steering_queue`, `clear_followup_slot`, `edit_followup_slot`.

### Requirement: Follow-up display chip caps rendered height and scrolls on overflow

The `queue-chip-followup` display element in `QueuePanel` SHALL cap its rendered height and scroll internally when entry text exceeds that height, rather than growing unbounded with the entry length. The cap SHALL match the project's existing capped-content idiom (`max-h-80 overflow-auto`, 320px) used across tool renderers. The cap SHALL NOT apply to edit mode (`queue-followup-editor`), which is already height-gated by its `rows` limit.

#### Scenario: short entry renders at natural height
- **WHEN** `pendingQueues.followUp` contains a single short entry
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL render at its natural content height with no scrollbar

#### Scenario: oversized entry caps height and scrolls
- **WHEN** a follow-up entry's rendered text exceeds the chip height cap
- **THEN** `queue-chip-followup` SHALL constrain its height to the cap (`max-h-80`)
- **AND** SHALL expose a vertical scrollbar (`overflow-auto`) for the overflow
- **AND** SHALL NOT push the chat input or surrounding layout off-screen

#### Scenario: edit mode height-gating unchanged
- **WHEN** the user opens the inline editor (`queue-followup-editor`)
- **THEN** the editor SHALL remain gated by its existing `rows` limit
- **AND** the display chip's `max-h-80 overflow-auto` cap SHALL NOT alter editor behavior
