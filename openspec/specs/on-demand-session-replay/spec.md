# on-demand-session-replay Specification

## Purpose

Loads session events on demand when a browser subscribes to a session whose events have been evicted from the in-memory buffer. The server reads session files directly from disk without requiring a bridge connection.
## Requirements
### Requirement: On-demand session loading via server
When a browser subscribes to a session whose events are not in memory, the server SHALL load the session directly from pi's session file on disk using `SessionManager.open(sessionFile).getBranch()`, without routing through a bridge.

#### Scenario: Browser subscribes to evicted session
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes to session "abc" whose events are not in memory, and the session has a `sessionFile` path
- **THEN** the server SHALL send an immediate `event_replay { events: [], isLast: false }` to the browser, load the session file directly via `SessionManager.open(sessionFile).getBranch()`, convert entries via `replayEntriesAsEvents()`, store in the event buffer, and send `event_replay { events, isLast: true }` to the browser

#### Scenario: Session file unavailable
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes to a session whose `sessionFile` does not exist, is corrupted, or is not set
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `event_replay { events: [], isLast: true }` and `session_updated { dataUnavailable: true }`

#### Scenario: Multiple browsers subscribe to same evicted session
- **WHEN** two browsers subscribe to the same evicted session before the load completes
- **THEN** the server SHALL deduplicate the load and deliver loaded events to both browsers

#### Scenario: Loaded events are buffered for future requests
- **WHEN** events are loaded on demand from disk
- **THEN** the server SHALL store them in the in-memory event buffer so subsequent browser subscribes do not trigger another load

### Requirement: Batch replay for on-demand loaded events
On-demand loaded events SHALL be delivered as batch `event_replay` messages, not as individual live `event` broadcasts. This prevents confusion between live streaming events and historical replay.

#### Scenario: Server receives loaded events
- **WHEN** the server loads events from a session file
- **THEN** it SHALL insert all events into the in-memory buffer, then send `event_replay { events, isLast: true }` to all waiting browsers

### Requirement: Client state reset on full replay
When the browser receives a full `event_replay` (first event has `seq === 1`), the client SHALL reset the session's `SessionState` to its initial state before reducing the replayed events. This prevents duplicate messages when switching between session cards or re-subscribing after a WebSocket reconnect. See the `event-reducer` spec for implementation details.

#### Scenario: Switching to a previously-subscribed session
- **WHEN** a user switches to a session card that was already loaded, triggering a new full replay
- **THEN** the client SHALL reset state and reduce from scratch, producing the same result as a fresh page load

#### Scenario: Live events not affected by loading
- **WHEN** live `event_forward` messages arrive for an active session while a different session is being loaded
- **THEN** the live events SHALL be broadcast normally to subscribers — loading only applies to the specific session being loaded

### Requirement: Stale lastSeq detection on subscribe
The subscription handler SHALL detect when a browser's `lastSeq` exceeds the server's max stored seq, and trigger a full reset-and-replay.

#### Scenario: Stale lastSeq triggers reset
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with `lastSeq: 500` and the server has events up to seq `10` for that session
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `session_state_reset` to that browser WebSocket
- **AND** replay all events from seq 1

#### Scenario: Valid lastSeq returns delta
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with `lastSeq: 50` and the server has events up to seq `100`
- **THEN** the server SHALL replay events with seq 51–100 without sending `session_state_reset`

### Requirement: Replay accepts a caller-supplied contextWindow override
The system SHALL allow callers of `replayEntriesAsEvents(sessionId, entries, knownContextWindow?)` to supply an optional `knownContextWindow` value. When provided, every synthesized `stats_update.contextUsage.contextWindow` field SHALL be set to that value; when omitted, the system SHALL fall back to `inferContextWindow(currentModel)`.

The server's on-demand replay path (`directoryService.loadSessionEvents`) SHALL forward `session.contextWindow` (loaded from `.meta.json`) as `knownContextWindow` so synthesized events surface the persisted value rather than the model-id heuristic.

Rationale: pi's `.jsonl` has no persisted `contextUsage`, so without the override every replayed `stats_update` for a Claude session reports `200_000` even when the live session ran on a 1M variant. This causes a visible flicker from `1M` → `200k` whenever a browser opens an ended session, until the next live `turn_end` arrives.

#### Scenario: Replay uses knownContextWindow when provided
- **GIVEN** an ended session with persisted `contextWindow: 1_000_000` in `.meta.json`
- **WHEN** the server's `loadSessionEvents` calls `replayEntriesAsEvents(sessionId, entries, 1_000_000)`
- **THEN** every emitted `stats_update.contextUsage.contextWindow` SHALL equal `1_000_000`

#### Scenario: Replay falls back to inference when override is undefined
- **GIVEN** a caller that does not supply `knownContextWindow`
- **WHEN** `replayEntriesAsEvents` synthesizes a `stats_update` for an assistant message with `usage.totalTokens > 0` after a `model_change` to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **THEN** the emitted `stats_update.contextUsage.contextWindow` SHALL equal `inferContextWindow("claude-sonnet-4-20250514")` (`200_000`)

#### Scenario: Server forwards persisted contextWindow through subscription replay
- **GIVEN** a browser subscribes to an ended session whose `Session.contextWindow` is `1_000_000`
- **WHEN** `subscription-handler` invokes `directoryService.loadSessionEvents(sessionId, sessionFile, session.contextWindow)`
- **THEN** every synthesized `stats_update` event delivered to the browser SHALL carry `contextUsage.contextWindow: 1_000_000`

### Requirement: Replay reconstructs persisted flow runs

`replayEntriesAsEvents` SHALL synthesize `event_forward` messages from persisted flow-run entries so a flow card rebuilds after `/resume`, browser refresh, or dashboard server restart.

For each session entry where `entry.type === "custom"` AND `entry.customType === "flow-event"`, replay SHALL read the record shape `{ seq: number, eventType: string, data: unknown, flowRunId: string }` and emit one `event_forward` message carrying that record's `eventType` and `data` verbatim. The `eventType` is already the dashboard protocol name (e.g. `flow_tool_call`), so replay SHALL NOT re-map it.

Replay SHALL order the emitted flow-event messages by ascending `seq`. The record type is duck-typed; replay SHALL NOT import any type from pi-flows.

Malformed flow-event records (missing or non-string `eventType`) SHALL be skipped without throwing.

#### Scenario: Persisted flow events replayed in seq order
- **WHEN** a session JSONL contains `flow-event` custom entries with `seq` 0,1,2 mapping to `flow_started`, `flow_agent_started`, `flow_tool_call`
- **THEN** `replayEntriesAsEvents` SHALL emit three `event_forward` messages with those `eventType` values, in `seq` order, each carrying the record's `data`

#### Scenario: Custom non-flow entries ignored
- **WHEN** a session JSONL contains a `type:"custom"` entry whose `customType` is not `"flow-event"`
- **THEN** replay SHALL NOT emit an `event_forward` for it

#### Scenario: Malformed flow-event record skipped
- **WHEN** a `flow-event` custom entry has a missing or non-string `eventType`
- **THEN** replay SHALL skip the entry and continue without throwing

#### Scenario: Existing message and model_change replay unaffected
- **WHEN** a session JSONL contains `message` and `model_change` entries alongside `flow-event` entries
- **THEN** replay SHALL still synthesize the message and model_change events exactly as before, in addition to the flow-event messages

### Requirement: Replayed events reach the plugin-runtime event store

Server-side replay is necessary but not sufficient for the flow card to reappear: the dashboard client SHALL deliver replayed session events into the plugin-runtime per-session event store (`publishSessionEvent` / plural `publishSessionEvents`) so plugin slot consumers reading `useSessionEvents(sessionId)` rehydrate on cold load (`/resume`, browser refresh, server restart), matching the live `event` path.

Rationale: the flow card claim (`FlowDashboardClaim`, slot `content-header-sticky`) declares no `shouldRender` gate; it self-gates on `flowState !== null`, derived solely from `useSessionEvents` via `reduceFlowsSessionState`. The shell reducer's `sessionStates` is NOT read by flows-plugin. Subagent cards survive replay only because their state lives in the shell reducer (`SessionState.subagents`), which the `event_replay` loop already feeds; plugin-owned state needs the same delivery into the plugin store. Before this requirement, the client `event_replay` handler folded the batch into `sessionStates` but never called `publishSessionEvent`, so `useSessionEvents` stayed empty on cold load and the slot never reattached.

The client SHALL reuse the same `shouldReset` condition the shell reducer applies: on a full-replay sweep it SHALL clear the plugin store for the session before republishing (so re-replay does not duplicate events); on a continuation batch it SHALL append without clearing.

The per-append cost is bounded by the shell's existing `event_replay` reduce loop (which already rebuilds `sessionStates` over the same N events on every cold load); the plural `publishSessionEvents` keeps the plugin-store delivery to one array spread and one subscriber notification.

This applies to every plugin reading `useSessionEvents` (flows, goal-plugin), not only flows.

#### Scenario: Replayed flow events rebuild plugin flow state on cold load
- **WHEN** an `event_replay` batch containing `flow_started` and `flow_tool_call` is processed by the client
- **THEN** `getSessionEvents(sessionId)` SHALL contain those events AND `reduceFlowsSessionState(getSessionEvents(sessionId))` SHALL yield a non-null `flowState`

#### Scenario: Re-replay does not duplicate plugin events
- **WHEN** a full-replay sweep (`shouldReset` true) is processed after the plugin store already holds events for the session
- **THEN** the client SHALL clear the store before republishing so each event appears exactly once

#### Scenario: Continuation batch appends without clearing
- **WHEN** a paginated continuation `event_replay` batch (`shouldReset` false) is processed
- **THEN** the client SHALL append the batch to the existing plugin store without clearing

#### Scenario: Actions subcard availability is a separate non-replayed signal
- **WHEN** a session cold-loads with replayed flow events but no live `flows_list`/`commands_list` has been re-published
- **THEN** the flow card (`FlowDashboardClaim`) SHALL reattach (it has no availability gate), while the actions subcard (`SessionFlowActionsClaim`, gated by `shouldRenderFlowsSubcard` → `getFlowsAvailabilitySync`) MAY remain hidden until availability is rehydrated; rehydrating availability from replayed flow events or re-publishing the flows list on subscribe is tracked as follow-up

### Requirement: Durable replay depends on upstream flush of custom entries (KNOWN BLOCKER)

This replay requirement is **necessary but not sufficient** for reload survival: it SHALL only reconstruct what reached the session JSONL on disk. Persisted `flow-event` entries reach disk only when pi-core flushes them, and the system SHALL NOT assume that flow-first sessions are durable until the upstream flush (below) lands.

pi-core `SessionManager._persist` gates the session-file flush on the FIRST assistant message: it buffers ALL entries (including `type:"custom"` `flow-event` records) in memory and does not create the `.jsonl` until an `role:"assistant"` message is appended. Therefore a **flow-first session** (flow run as the first action, no assistant message yet) has NO file on disk, and this replay finds nothing — the flow card AND graph (both projections of the same event stream) fail to rebuild on dashboard server restart, cold load, or `/resume`.

Proven by controlled experiment: 3 `appendCustomEntry("flow-event", …)` calls produce no file; the file appears with all 3 entries only after the first `appendMessage({role:"assistant"})`. Confirmed on real data: session `019eeecc` buffered 184 `flow-event` entries (first at line 5) and flushed them all at the first assistant message (line 190); replaying that real file through the shipped branch reconstructs the full `flow_*` stream.

No manual or programmatic trigger reachable from pi-flows or the dashboard can open the gate: `ctx.sessionManager` is `ReadonlySessionManager` (no append/flush), `appendEntry` writes `type:"custom"` (never opens the gate), `sendMessage` writes `custom_message`, `sendUserMessage` writes a `user` message. The flush gate inspects only `type:"message" && role:"assistant"` and ignores content, so an empty or sentinel assistant message would open it — but `buildSessionContext` forwards every `message` entry to the provider verbatim with no empty-content filter, so that approach risks provider rejection and SHALL NOT be used.

Resolution is OUTSIDE this capability and OUTSIDE this repo — it requires an upstream change in `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Preferred: flush on an opt-in `type:"custom"` flush-marker entry (writable from pi-flows via `appendEntry`, excluded from LLM context by `buildSessionContext`, preserves the gate's no-empty-files purpose, works mid-flow). Acceptable alternatives: flush all custom entries immediately, or expose a `flush()` API. The ExtensionAPI currently exposes no flush surface, so neither pi-flows nor the dashboard can close this gap. A dashboard-side alternative (persist forwarded events to the dashboard's own per-session store and replay from it on cold load) is possible but heavier and duplicative; it is explicitly deferred.

Until the upstream flush lands, the live multi-client path (server in-memory event buffer replayed on subscribe) still rebuilds the card for clients attaching while the server is up; only durable reload across a server restart / cold / resume is blocked.

#### Scenario: Flow-first session has no file to replay
- **WHEN** a flow runs as the first action in a session and no assistant message has been appended
- **THEN** pi-core has not created the session `.jsonl`, so `replayEntriesAsEvents` has no entries to read and the flow card cannot be rebuilt on cold load

#### Scenario: Buffered flow events flush on first assistant message
- **WHEN** the parent session appends its first `role:"assistant"` message after a flow ran
- **THEN** pi-core flushes all buffered entries (including every `flow-event` record and `flow_started`/graph data) to the `.jsonl`, and subsequent replay reconstructs the full card and graph

#### Scenario: Empty assistant message rejected as a flush workaround
- **WHEN** considering whether to append an empty or sentinel-character `role:"assistant"` message to force the flush
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT do so, because `buildSessionContext` forwards that message to the provider verbatim (no empty-content filter), risking provider rejection of an empty turn and alternation errors on the next real turn

#### Scenario: Custom flush-marker is the preferred upstream resolution
- **WHEN** the upstream flush fix is implemented in `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
- **THEN** it SHOULD flush on an opt-in `type:"custom"` flush-marker entry (writable from pi-flows via `appendEntry`, excluded from LLM context by `buildSessionContext`), rather than by injecting any `message` entry

### Requirement: Subscribe-time replay MAY be bounded to a configured window

When `memoryLimits.maxReplayEvents` is greater than zero, the server SHALL deliver at most that many events per full-stream subscription. The delivered shape SHALL be determined by `memoryLimits.replayWindowMode`: in `head-tail` a head segment plus a tail segment with an elided middle; in `tail-only` a tail segment alone, with the elided region unbounded above. When `maxReplayEvents` is zero, replay SHALL be unbounded, `replayWindowMode` SHALL have no effect, and behavior SHALL be identical to the prior implementation.

#### Scenario: Windowing disabled by default

- **WHEN** `maxReplayEvents` is `0` and a client subscribes to a session with 50000 stored events
- **THEN** the server SHALL replay all 50000 events
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT emit a `history_window` message carrying a non-zero `gapCount`

#### Scenario: Window applied to a full stream in `head-tail`

- **WHEN** `maxReplayEvents` is `500`, `replayWindowMode` is `head-tail`, and a client subscribes with `lastSeq: 0` to a session whose compacted stream holds 5000 events
- **THEN** the server SHALL deliver at most 500 events
- **AND** the delivered events SHALL comprise a head segment beginning at the lowest stored seq and a tail segment ending at the highest stored seq

#### Scenario: Window applied to a full stream in `tail-only`

- **WHEN** `maxReplayEvents` is `500`, `replayWindowMode` is `tail-only`, and a client subscribes with `lastSeq: 0` to a session whose compacted stream holds 5000 events
- **THEN** the server SHALL deliver at most 500 events
- **AND** the delivered events SHALL comprise a tail segment alone, ending at the highest stored seq
- **AND** no delivered event SHALL precede the tail segment
- **AND** the announced `headMaxSeq` SHALL be `0`

#### Scenario: `tail-only` is inert when windowing is off

- **WHEN** `replayWindowMode` is `tail-only` and `maxReplayEvents` is `0`
- **THEN** the server SHALL replay the full stream
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT emit a `history_window` message carrying a non-zero `gapCount`

#### Scenario: Session smaller than the window is delivered whole

- **WHEN** `maxReplayEvents` is `1000` and the compacted stream holds 40 events
- **THEN** the server SHALL deliver all 40 events exactly once
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT emit a `history_window` message at all, because no window was applied
- **AND** no event SHALL appear more than once in the delivered stream

### Requirement: Windowing is determined by stream content, not by call site

The server SHALL apply the window when the array being delivered is a full stream, and SHALL NOT apply it when the array is a delta. A subscription carrying `lastSeq` of `0` SHALL be treated as a full stream even though it is served by the same branch as deltas.

#### Scenario: Warm reload with no cached cursor is windowed

- **WHEN** a client subscribes with `lastSeq: 0` to a session the server already holds in memory
- **THEN** the server SHALL apply the configured window

#### Scenario: Genuine delta is never windowed

- **WHEN** a client subscribes with `lastSeq` greater than `0` and not greater than the server's max seq
- **THEN** the server SHALL deliver every event after `lastSeq` without applying a window
- **AND** the delivered seq range SHALL contain no gap relative to `lastSeq`

### Requirement: The replay high-water mark is derived from the full input

`sendEventBatches` SHALL return the highest seq of the array it received, computed before compaction and before windowing.

#### Scenario: High-water mark survives an elided top

- **WHEN** compaction or windowing removes the highest-seq event from the delivered stream
- **THEN** the returned high-water mark SHALL still equal the highest seq of the input array
- **AND** the subsequent catch-up query SHALL return no events

### Requirement: A windowed replay announces its gap

On every full-stream path the server SHALL emit exactly one `history_window` message per subscriber before the first `event_replay` batch, reporting `headMaxSeq`, `tailMinSeq`, `gapCount`, and `oldestGapSeq`. `gapCount` SHALL be the number of gap events the store actually holds, never the arithmetic seq distance between the segments.

#### Scenario: Gap announced before batches

- **WHEN** a windowed replay begins for a subscriber
- **THEN** the subscriber SHALL receive `history_window` before any `event_replay` for that session

#### Scenario: Delta subscribe emits no window message

- **WHEN** a client subscribes with `lastSeq` greater than `0`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT emit a `history_window` message

#### Scenario: gapCount excludes events the store has trimmed

- **WHEN** the store has already trimmed part of the middle of a session, so the stored array is non-contiguous
- **THEN** the reported `gapCount` SHALL equal the number of gap events still present in the store
- **AND** `gapCount` SHALL be less than `tailMinSeq - headMaxSeq - 1`

### Requirement: A windowed replay resets client state explicitly

When a window is applied to a full-stream replay, the server SHALL send `session_state_reset` before the replay, on EVERY path that can deliver a windowed full stream — the warm-store subscribe, the stale-`lastSeq` re-replay, and the cold disk-hydration fan-out. The reset SHALL NOT depend on the delivered stream beginning at seq `1`, because a `tail-only` window never delivers seq `1`.

#### Scenario: Reset precedes a windowed replay

- **WHEN** a window is applied for a client subscribing with `lastSeq: 0`
- **THEN** the client SHALL receive `session_state_reset` before the first delivered event
- **AND** the resulting transcript SHALL contain no rows from a prior subscription

#### Scenario: Cold hydration resets before a windowed fan-out

- **WHEN** a session is hydrated from disk and its stored stream exceeds the configured window
- **THEN** every subscriber SHALL receive `session_state_reset` before the first delivered event of the hydration replay

#### Scenario: A head-free window does not rely on the `firstSeq === 1` reduction rule

- **WHEN** `replayWindowMode` is `tail-only`, a client already holds transcript rows for the session, and a windowed replay is delivered whose first seq is greater than `1`
- **THEN** the prior rows SHALL be discarded rather than retained
- **AND** the delivered tail SHALL NOT be appended beneath stale rows

### Requirement: Window segment boundaries snap inward

The tail segment's leading edge SHALL snap forward to the next `message_start` or `turn_start` within a bounded lookup. When the window has a head segment, that segment's trailing edge SHALL snap backward to a completed `message_end` within the same bound; when the window has no head segment, no head-edge snap SHALL be attempted. Neither snap SHALL increase the number of delivered events beyond the configured limit.

#### Scenario: Delivered count never exceeds the configured limit

- **WHEN** `maxReplayEvents` is `500` and boundary snapping is applied
- **THEN** the number of delivered events SHALL be less than or equal to `500`

#### Scenario: Tail opens on a message boundary

- **WHEN** the computed tail cut falls in the middle of an assistant message and a `message_start` exists within the lookup bound
- **THEN** the first delivered tail event SHALL be that `message_start`

#### Scenario: A head-free window snaps only its tail edge

- **WHEN** `replayWindowMode` is `tail-only` and a window is applied
- **THEN** the tail's leading edge SHALL snap forward as normal
- **AND** no head-edge snap SHALL be performed
- **AND** the delivered count SHALL remain within the configured limit

### Requirement: The client reducer tolerates orphaned events at a window edge

Replay SHALL NOT fail when a delivered segment begins or ends on an event whose structural partner was elided. A tool call left unfinished by a backfill segment SHALL resolve to a truthful terminal state rather than remaining indistinguishable from a tool that is still running.

#### Scenario: Orphaned message_end does not crash the reducer

- **WHEN** a delivered segment begins with a `message_end` whose `message_start` was elided
- **THEN** the reducer SHALL produce a state without throwing

#### Scenario: Orphaned tool_execution_end does not crash the reducer

- **WHEN** a delivered segment begins with a `tool_execution_end` whose `tool_execution_start` was elided
- **THEN** the reducer SHALL produce a state without throwing

#### Scenario: An unjoinable tool start in a backfill segment resolves to elided

- **WHEN** a backfill segment is fully reduced and contains a `tool_execution_start` with no `tool_execution_end` in that segment
- **THEN** that tool row SHALL carry status `elided`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT be rendered as running
- **AND** it SHALL NOT be rendered as an error

#### Scenario: A dangling tool at the live end of the stream stays running

- **WHEN** a windowed replay's tail ends with a `tool_execution_start` because the tool is still executing
- **THEN** that tool row SHALL carry status `running`
- **AND** it SHALL remain eligible for the stale running-tool reconcile

### Requirement: A windowed replay is not persisted to the client replay cache

When a window has been applied to a session's replay, the client SHALL NOT write that session's events to the durable replay cache.

#### Scenario: Windowed session is not cached

- **WHEN** a client receives a `history_window` with `gapCount` greater than `0` and completes the replay
- **THEN** the client SHALL NOT persist that session's payload to the replay cache

#### Scenario: Reload after a windowed replay re-windows

- **WHEN** a client reloads after a windowed replay of a session whose payload would fit the cache byte cap
- **THEN** the client SHALL subscribe with `lastSeq: 0`
- **AND** the client SHALL receive a `history_window` announcing the gap again

### Requirement: A windowed replay announces its shape

The gap announcement SHALL carry the shape of the window that produced it, so the client can determine whether the elided region is bounded above without inferring it from a numeric bound. The field SHALL be additive and optional: a client that does not read it SHALL behave as though the shape were `head-tail`, which is what a server that has not opted in always produces.

#### Scenario: Shape accompanies the gap announcement

- **WHEN** a window is applied and the gap is announced
- **THEN** the announcement SHALL state whether the window has a head segment

#### Scenario: The shape is not inferred from the head bound

- **WHEN** a client determines whether to floor its requests, to auto-load on scroll, or to resolve exhaustion to a terminus
- **THEN** it SHALL consult the announced shape
- **AND** it SHALL NOT derive the shape from `headMaxSeq` being `0`

#### Scenario: An older client degrades to the default shape

- **WHEN** a client that does not read the shape field receives an announcement carrying it
- **THEN** the client SHALL continue to behave as it does for a `head-tail` window
- **AND** no field it already reads SHALL have changed name or type
