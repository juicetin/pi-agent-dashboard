# open-in-editor Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change linkify-tool-output. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Editor detection
The system SHALL detect available native editors by checking if the editor application process is currently running AND the corresponding CLI binary is available on the system PATH. Native editor buttons (e.g., Zed) SHALL appear in the folder action bar instead of per-session-card placement. The `code`/`vscode` native editor entry SHALL be excluded from the action bar since VS Code is now served via the browser-based EditorView.

Process detection SHALL use `pgrep`:
- **macOS**: `pgrep -f "<app-bundle-path>"` (e.g., `/Applications/Zed.app`)
- **Linux**: `pgrep -x "<process-name>"` (e.g., `zed`)

If `pgrep` is not available or fails, the editor SHALL be treated as not running.

#### Scenario: Zed is running and CLI is available
- **WHEN** the Zed application process is running and `zed` CLI is on PATH
- **THEN** the Zed button SHALL appear in the folder action bar

#### Scenario: VS Code native entry excluded
- **WHEN** VS Code is running with `code` CLI available
- **THEN** the `code`/`vscode` entry SHALL NOT appear as a native editor button in the action bar
- **THEN** VS Code is accessible via the Editor button (code-server) instead

#### Scenario: Editor is installed but not running
- **WHEN** `zed` CLI is on PATH but the Zed application is not running
- **THEN** the Zed button SHALL NOT appear in the action bar

#### Scenario: Editor is running but CLI not available
- **WHEN** the Zed application is running but `zed` CLI is not on PATH
- **THEN** the response SHALL NOT include Zed in the result

#### Scenario: Multiple editors running
- **WHEN** both Zed and VS Code processes are running with CLIs available
- **THEN** only non-VS Code editors SHALL appear as native editor buttons

#### Scenario: No editors running
- **WHEN** no recognized editor processes are running
- **THEN** no native editor buttons SHALL appear in the action bar

#### Scenario: pgrep not available
- **WHEN** `pgrep` is not found on the system
- **THEN** the detection SHALL return an empty array without error

### Requirement: Editor detection API
The server SHALL expose `GET /api/editors?path=<cwd>` that returns detected editors for the given path. The response SHALL follow the standard `ApiResponse` envelope with `data` containing an array of `{ id: string, name: string }`.

#### Scenario: Valid path with editors
- **WHEN** a GET request is made to `/api/editors?path=/some/project` and editors are detected
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ success: true, data: [{ id: "zed", name: "Zed" }] }`

#### Scenario: Missing path parameter
- **WHEN** a GET request is made to `/api/editors` without a path query parameter
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ success: false, error: "path parameter required" }`

### Requirement: Open editor endpoint
The server SHALL expose `POST /api/open-editor` accepting `{ path: string, editor: string, file?: string, line?: number }`. It SHALL validate that `path` matches a known session `cwd` and `editor` is a recognized editor ID, then spawn the editor CLI as a detached process. When `file` is provided, the editor SHALL open that specific file (resolved relative to `path`). When both `file` and `line` are provided, the editor SHALL open the file at the specified line using `file:line` syntax.

#### Scenario: Open project folder
- **WHEN** a POST request is made with `path` and `editor` only
- **THEN** the server SHALL spawn the editor CLI with the cwd as argument and respond with `{ success: true }`

#### Scenario: Open specific file
- **WHEN** a POST request includes `file: "src/main.ts"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL resolve the file path relative to `path` and open it in the editor

#### Scenario: Open file at line
- **WHEN** a POST request includes `file: "src/main.ts"` and `line: 42`
- **THEN** the server SHALL open the file at line 42 using `path/src/main.ts:42` syntax

#### Scenario: Unknown path
- **WHEN** a POST request is made with a path that does not match any session's cwd
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ success: false, error: "unknown session path" }`

#### Scenario: Unknown editor
- **WHEN** a POST request is made with an editor ID not in the registry
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ success: false, error: "unknown editor" }`

### Requirement: Localhost-only access
The open-editor and editor detection endpoints SHALL only be accessible from localhost. Requests from non-loopback addresses SHALL be rejected.

#### Scenario: Request from localhost
- **WHEN** a request to `/api/open-editor` originates from `127.0.0.1` or `::1`
- **THEN** the server SHALL process the request normally

#### Scenario: Request from remote address
- **WHEN** a request to `/api/open-editor` originates from a non-loopback IP
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ success: false, error: "localhost only" }`

### Requirement: Windows editor detection
The editor registry SHALL include Windows-specific process patterns and CLI detection for supported editors.

#### Scenario: Detect VS Code on Windows
- **WHEN** editor detection runs on Windows
- **THEN** it SHALL check for `code.cmd` on PATH and common install paths (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\`)

#### Scenario: Detect IntelliJ on Windows
- **WHEN** editor detection runs on Windows
- **THEN** it SHALL check for `idea64.exe` on PATH and common JetBrains Toolbox paths

#### Scenario: Platform-aware process pattern
- **WHEN** the editor registry defines process patterns
- **THEN** it SHALL include a `win32` key alongside existing `darwin` and `linux` keys

### Requirement: Open-editor invocation from linkified tool output

Linkified file references inside tool output (see `tool-output-linkification`) SHALL invoke the same `POST /api/open-editor` endpoint that the existing `OpenFileButton` uses. The endpoint contract MUST NOT change: request body retains `path` (session cwd), `editor` (editor id), `file` (file path), `line` (1-based line number, optional).

Linkified-output invocations MUST resolve relative file paths against the active `ToolContext.cwd` before sending the request. The endpoint MUST continue to enforce its existing localhost-only gate; remote callers MUST receive the same rejection they get today and the client MUST fall back to the in-dashboard preview overlay defined in `tool-output-linkification`.

#### Scenario: localhost file-link click
- **GIVEN** `isLocalhost()` returns true and a VS Code editor is detected for the session cwd `/Users/me/repo`
- **WHEN** the user clicks a file link with `path="src/foo.ts"` and `line=42` rendered inside a bash tool result
- **THEN** the client SHALL POST `{ path: "/Users/me/repo", editor: "code", file: "src/foo.ts", line: 42 }` to `/api/open-editor`

#### Scenario: remote file-link click falls back to preview
- **GIVEN** the dashboard origin is not localhost
- **WHEN** the user clicks a file link inside a tool result
- **THEN** no request SHALL be sent to `/api/open-editor`
- **AND** the in-dashboard preview overlay SHALL open
