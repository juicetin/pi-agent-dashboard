## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Session card shows attach combo box when no proposal attached
Each session card SHALL display a `<select>` dropdown listing available changes from the folder-level OpenSpec data when the session has no attached proposal and the directory has initialized OpenSpec data.

#### Scenario: Combo box lists available changes
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` in cwd `/project/foo` has `attachedProposal = null` and the folder has changes `["add-auth", "fix-bug", "refactor-db"]`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show a dropdown with options: placeholder "Attach change...", "add-auth", "fix-bug", "refactor-db"

#### Scenario: Selecting a change sends attach_proposal
- **WHEN** the user selects `"add-auth"` from the combo box on session `"s1"`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal", sessionId: "s1", changeName: "add-auth" }`

#### Scenario: No OpenSpec data available
- **WHEN** the session's directory has no OpenSpec data or `initialized: false`
- **THEN** no combo box SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: No changes available
- **WHEN** OpenSpec is initialized but has zero changes
- **THEN** the combo box SHALL be rendered as disabled with placeholder text "No changes"

#### Scenario: Changes sorted in combo box
- **WHEN** the folder has in-progress and completed changes
- **THEN** in-progress changes SHALL appear first in the dropdown, then completed changes

### Requirement: Unattached active session shows + Change and Explore buttons
When a session is active (not ended) and has no attached proposal, the `SessionOpenSpecActions` component SHALL render a "+ Change" button and an "Explore" button inline next to the attach combo box.

#### Scenario: Active session with no attachment shows buttons
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `status = "active"` and `attachedProposal = null`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show the attach combo box, a "+ Change" button, and an "Explore" button in a single row

#### Scenario: + Change opens NewChangeDialog
- **WHEN** the user clicks "+ Change" on session `"s1"`
- **THEN** a `NewChangeDialog` SHALL open

#### Scenario: + Change sends prompt to its own session
- **WHEN** the user fills in the NewChangeDialog and clicks Send on session `"s1"`
- **THEN** the `/opsx:new` prompt SHALL be sent via `onSendPrompt` to session `"s1"`

#### Scenario: Explore opens ExploreDialog with no change name
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Explore" on session `"s1"` with no attached proposal
- **THEN** an `ExploreDialog` SHALL open with an empty change name for general explore mode

#### Scenario: Ended session hides + Change and Explore
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `status = "ended"` and `attachedProposal = null`
- **THEN** neither "+ Change" nor "Explore" buttons SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: Attached session does not show + Change
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "my-change"`
- **THEN** the "+ Change" button SHALL NOT be rendered

### Requirement: PDST rendered as single button navigating to proposal
In both the attached badge line and the folder change list, artifact letters SHALL be rendered as a single combined button (`ArtifactLettersButton`). Each letter keeps its status color. Clicking the button navigates to the proposal artifact.

#### Scenario: Single PDST button in attached session
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` with artifacts `[proposal: done, design: ready, specs: blocked, tasks: blocked]`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show a single clickable button containing `P D S T` with green, yellow, muted, muted colors respectively

#### Scenario: Clicking PDST button opens proposal
- **WHEN** the user clicks the PDST button for change `"add-auth"`
- **THEN** `onReadArtifact("add-auth", "proposal")` SHALL be called

### Requirement: Session card displays ChangeState pill next to attached badge
When a session has an `attachedProposal` and the corresponding change is present in the folder's OpenSpec data, the session card SHALL render a small state pill adjacent to the attached-change badge displaying the `ChangeState` value (`PLANNING` / `READY` / `IMPLEMENTING` / `COMPLETE`) with a color-coded text/border scheme — zinc for `PLANNING`, blue for `READY`, amber for `IMPLEMENTING`, green for `COMPLETE`.

#### Scenario: IMPLEMENTING pill for in-progress change
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `deriveChangeState` returns `IMPLEMENTING`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL display a pill reading `IMPLEMENTING` in amber next to the `📋 add-auth` badge

#### Scenario: COMPLETE pill for completed change
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `deriveChangeState` returns `COMPLETE`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL display a pill reading `COMPLETE` in green next to the `📋 add-auth` badge

#### Scenario: Attached change missing from OpenSpec data hides pill
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "archived-change"` but the folder's OpenSpec data does not contain that change
- **THEN** no state pill SHALL be rendered

### Requirement: Session card shows attached change badge and actions when attached
When a session has an `attachedProposal`, the session card SHALL show the attached change name as a badge with `text-blue-400` color, a `ChangeState` pill next to the badge (per the "displays ChangeState pill" requirement), and LLM action buttons driven by `deriveChangeState`. When `deriveChangeState` returns `IMPLEMENTING` **and** the change has `isComplete === true` **and** all artifacts are `done`, the action row SHALL additionally expose an **Archive anyway** action in an overflow menu. Action buttons are disabled when session status is `streaming` and hidden when `ended`.

#### Scenario: Attached change badge with blue color
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL display `📋 add-auth` with the name in `text-blue-400`

#### Scenario: LLM action buttons for PLANNING state
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `deriveChangeState` returns `PLANNING`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show buttons: [Explore] [Continue] [FF] and [Detach]

#### Scenario: LLM action buttons for READY state
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `deriveChangeState` returns `READY`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show buttons: [Explore] [Apply] and [Detach]

#### Scenario: LLM action buttons for IMPLEMENTING state
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `deriveChangeState` returns `IMPLEMENTING`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show buttons: [Explore] [Apply] and [Detach]

#### Scenario: LLM action buttons for COMPLETE state
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `deriveChangeState` returns `COMPLETE`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show buttons: [Explore] [Verify] [Archive] and [Detach]

#### Scenario: Archive-anyway overflow action for artifacts-done IMPLEMENTING
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"`, `deriveChangeState` returns `IMPLEMENTING`, `change.isComplete === true`, and every artifact has `status === "done"`
- **THEN** the action row SHALL include an overflow menu (⋯) containing an **Archive anyway** item
- **AND** selecting **Archive anyway** SHALL open a `ConfirmDialog` with message "N of M tasks are unchecked. Archive anyway?"
- **AND** confirming SHALL send `send_prompt` with text `/opsx:archive add-auth` to the session

#### Scenario: Archive-anyway not shown when isComplete is false or undefined
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` is IMPLEMENTING but `change.isComplete !== true` (false or undefined)
- **THEN** no **Archive anyway** action SHALL be offered

#### Scenario: Action buttons disabled when streaming
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and `status = "streaming"`
- **THEN** action buttons (Explore, Continue, FF, Apply, Verify, Archive, Archive anyway) SHALL be shown but disabled

#### Scenario: Verify button sends verify command
- **WHEN** the user clicks [Verify] on session `"s1"` with attached change `"add-auth"`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `send_prompt` with text `/opsx:verify add-auth` to session `"s1"`

#### Scenario: Action buttons send prompt to session
- **WHEN** the user clicks [Continue] on session `"s1"` with attached change `"add-auth"`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `send_prompt` with text `/opsx:continue add-auth` to session `"s1"`

#### Scenario: Detach button clears attachment
- **WHEN** the user clicks [Detach] on session `"s1"`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `{ type: "detach_proposal", sessionId: "s1" }`
- **AND** the combo box SHALL reappear

#### Scenario: Ended session hides action buttons
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "add-auth"` but `status = "ended"`
- **THEN** the badge SHALL still show but LLM action buttons SHALL be hidden

#### Scenario: Attached change not in OpenSpec data
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "archived-change"` but the folder's OpenSpec data does not contain that change
- **THEN** the badge SHALL still show `📋 archived-change` with a [Detach] button but no LLM action buttons

### Requirement: Bulk Archive button on session card when completed changes exist
The `SessionOpenSpecActions` component SHALL render a "Bulk Archive" button **only on unattached sessions** when at least one change in the folder has `status === "complete"`. Attached-session action rows SHALL NOT render a Bulk Archive button.

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive shown on unattached session when completed changes exist
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has no attached proposal, is in cwd `/project/foo`, and the folder has changes `["done-change" (complete), "wip-change" (in-progress)]`
- **THEN** the session card SHALL show a "Bulk Archive" button alongside the attach combo box

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive hidden when no completed changes
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has no attached proposal and all folder changes have status `in-progress` or `active`
- **THEN** no "Bulk Archive" button SHALL appear

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive hidden on attached sessions
- **WHEN** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "my-change"` and the folder also contains a completed change
- **THEN** the attached-session action row SHALL NOT render a "Bulk Archive" button

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive confirmation dialog
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Bulk Archive" on an unattached session `"s1"`
- **THEN** a confirmation dialog SHALL appear with message "Bulk archive all completed changes?"

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive confirmed sends message
- **WHEN** the user confirms the Bulk Archive dialog on a session with cwd `/project/foo`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `{ type: "openspec_bulk_archive", cwd: "/project/foo" }`

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive cancelled
- **WHEN** the user cancels the Bulk Archive dialog
- **THEN** no action SHALL be taken

#### Scenario: Bulk Archive disabled when streaming
- **WHEN** unattached session `"s1"` has `status = "streaming"` and completed changes exist
- **THEN** the "Bulk Archive" button SHALL be shown but disabled

### Requirement: Mobile session header shows attached-proposal chip
On mobile viewports, the session header SHALL render a paperclip-prefixed chip displaying `session.attachedProposal` whenever that field is non-empty. When the chip is rendered, the mobile session header SHALL use a **two-row layout**:

- **Row 1**: back button (when applicable), session title (which now claims the full available width of row 1, no longer competing with the chip), `MobileAttachButton` (paperclip icon + popover), and `MobileActionMenu` (kebab).
- **Row 2**: the attached-proposal chip — paperclip icon, change name, `ArtifactLettersButton` pill (when `openspecChanges` matches), and `attached-proposal-task-counter` (when `totalTasks > 0`).

When `session.attachedProposal` is `null`, `undefined`, or empty string, the mobile session header SHALL render as a single row exactly as before — there is no empty second row reserved.

The chip remains visually distinct (blue accent) and continues to degrade gracefully on narrow widths via truncation with the full change name available as a `title` attribute. The chip SHALL be read-only — action affordances (attach, detach) remain in the existing `MobileAttachButton` popover.

#### Scenario: Attached proposal is rendered as a chip on row 2
- **WHEN** the viewport is mobile and `session.attachedProposal === "add-auth"`
- **THEN** the mobile session header SHALL render with a `flex-col` (two-row) container
- **AND** row 1 SHALL contain the session title, `MobileAttachButton`, and `MobileActionMenu`
- **AND** row 2 SHALL contain the chip with the paperclip icon and the text `add-auth`
- **AND** the chip SHALL carry `data-testid="mobile-header-attached-chip"`
- **AND** the chip SHALL NOT be a child of the same row as the session title

#### Scenario: No attached proposal hides the chip and keeps a single row
- **WHEN** the viewport is mobile and `session.attachedProposal` is `null`, `undefined`, or empty string
- **THEN** the mobile session header SHALL render as a single-row container (no `flex-col` wrapper, no empty second row)
- **AND** the chip SHALL NOT be present in the DOM

#### Scenario: Long change name is truncated with full text in tooltip
- **WHEN** the viewport is mobile and `session.attachedProposal` is a string longer than the chip's row-2 width
- **THEN** the visible chip text SHALL be truncated with CSS ellipsis
- **AND** the chip's `title` attribute SHALL contain the full change name prefixed with `Attached: `

#### Scenario: Chip updates reactively on session_updated
- **WHEN** the server broadcasts `session_updated` with `updates.attachedProposal = "feature-x"`
- **THEN** the mobile session header SHALL re-render as a two-row layout with `feature-x` in the row-2 chip within the next paint frame
- **WHEN** the server broadcasts `session_updated` with `updates.attachedProposal = null`
- **THEN** the mobile session header SHALL collapse back to a single-row layout and the chip SHALL be removed from the DOM

#### Scenario: Session name claims full row-1 width
- **WHEN** the viewport is 360px wide on mobile and `session.attachedProposal === "add-extension-ui-decorations"`
- **THEN** the row-1 session-title `<span>` SHALL have access to all horizontal space between the back button and the `MobileAttachButton` + `MobileActionMenu` group
- **AND** the title SHALL NOT be constrained by the chip's previous `max-w-[55%]` (which only applied when chip and title shared a row)

### Requirement: Mobile session card shows attached-proposal chip
On mobile viewports, each session card SHALL render a paperclip-prefixed chip displaying `session.attachedProposal` whenever that field is non-empty. The chip SHALL coexist with `OpenSpecActivityBadge` (which reads the distinct `openspecPhase` / `openspecChange` fields) — both MAY render simultaneously and MUST NOT visually collide.

#### Scenario: Attached proposal is rendered as a card chip
- **WHEN** the viewport is mobile and `session.attachedProposal === "add-auth"`
- **THEN** the mobile session card SHALL render a chip with the paperclip icon and the text `add-auth`
- **AND** the chip SHALL carry `data-testid="mobile-card-attached-chip"`

#### Scenario: Coexistence with OpenSpec activity badge
- **WHEN** a mobile session card has both `attachedProposal: "add-auth"` and `openspecPhase: "applying"` with `openspecChange: "fix-bug"`
- **THEN** both `mobile-card-attached-chip` and the `OpenSpecActivityBadge` SHALL render
- **AND** the two SHALL be visually distinguishable (the attached chip is blue with the change name; the activity badge carries phase + count semantics)

#### Scenario: No attached proposal hides the chip
- **WHEN** the viewport is mobile and `session.attachedProposal` is null, undefined, or empty
- **THEN** the mobile session card SHALL NOT render the attached-proposal chip

### Requirement: Idempotent auto-rename on attach
When a browser sends `attach_proposal`, the server SHALL set `session.name = changeName` if EITHER the current name is empty/whitespace OR the current name equals the current `session.attachedProposal` (i.e. the name was previously auto-set by an earlier attach and the user has not customised it). When the name was auto-set, the server SHALL forward `rename_session` to the bridge so pi's session name is kept in sync.

#### Scenario: Fresh session — name auto-set on first attach
- **WHEN** session has `name: undefined` and `attachedProposal: null`
- **AND** the browser sends `attach_proposal { changeName: "add-auth" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.name = "add-auth"` and `session.attachedProposal = "add-auth"`
- **AND** the server SHALL send `rename_session { name: "add-auth" }` to the bridge
- **AND** the server SHALL broadcast `session_updated` with `updates = { attachedProposal: "add-auth", name: "add-auth" }`

#### Scenario: Custom-named session — name preserved on attach
- **WHEN** session has `name: "my custom"` and `attachedProposal: null`
- **AND** the browser sends `attach_proposal { changeName: "add-auth" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.attachedProposal = "add-auth"` only
- **AND** `session.name` SHALL remain `"my custom"`
- **AND** no `rename_session` SHALL be sent to the bridge

#### Scenario: Re-attach after auto-rename — name re-tracks new change
- **WHEN** session has `name: "foo"` and `attachedProposal: "foo"` (auto-set on a previous attach)
- **AND** the browser sends `attach_proposal { changeName: "bar" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.name = "bar"` and `session.attachedProposal = "bar"`
- **AND** the server SHALL send `rename_session { name: "bar" }` to the bridge

#### Scenario: User-customised name — never override on re-attach
- **WHEN** session has `name: "my custom"` and `attachedProposal: "foo"` (user customised after auto-rename)
- **AND** the browser sends `attach_proposal { changeName: "bar" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.attachedProposal = "bar"` only
- **AND** `session.name` SHALL remain `"my custom"`
- **AND** no `rename_session` SHALL be sent to the bridge

### Requirement: Idempotent auto-rename revert on detach
When a browser sends `detach_proposal`, the server SHALL clear `session.name` (set to `undefined`) if and only if the current `session.name` equals the current `session.attachedProposal` (i.e. the name was auto-set on a previous attach). When the name was auto-cleared, the server SHALL forward `rename_session` with an empty name to the bridge so pi's session name is reset.

#### Scenario: Auto-set name reverted on detach
- **WHEN** session has `name: "foo"` and `attachedProposal: "foo"`
- **AND** the browser sends `detach_proposal`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.name = undefined`, `session.attachedProposal = null`, `session.openspecPhase = null`, `session.openspecChange = null`
- **AND** the server SHALL send `rename_session { name: "" }` to the bridge
- **AND** the broadcast `session_updated` payload SHALL contain `updates.name = undefined` so the client falls back to `firstMessage` / cwd basename

#### Scenario: User-customised name preserved on detach
- **WHEN** session has `name: "my custom"` and `attachedProposal: "foo"`
- **AND** the browser sends `detach_proposal`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.attachedProposal = null`, `session.openspecPhase = null`, `session.openspecChange = null`
- **AND** `session.name` SHALL remain `"my custom"`
- **AND** no `rename_session` SHALL be sent to the bridge

#### Scenario: Already-empty name unchanged on detach
- **WHEN** session has `name: undefined` and `attachedProposal: "foo"`
- **AND** the browser sends `detach_proposal`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `attachedProposal: null`, `openspecPhase: null`, `openspecChange: null`
- **AND** `session.name` SHALL remain `undefined`
- **AND** no `rename_session` SHALL be sent to the bridge

#### Scenario: Name set with no attachment is preserved on a defensive detach
- **WHEN** session has `name: "foo"` and `attachedProposal: null` (defensive: no auto-set witness)
- **AND** the browser sends `detach_proposal`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `attachedProposal: null`, `openspecPhase: null`, `openspecChange: null`
- **AND** `session.name` SHALL remain `"foo"`
- **AND** no `rename_session` SHALL be sent to the bridge

### Requirement: Idempotent auto-rename on auto-detected attach
When the OpenSpec activity detector emits a `changeName` from a `tool_execution_start` event with `isActive: true` (write/CLI activity, not passive reads), the server SHALL apply the same idempotent witness rule used for browser-initiated `attach_proposal`. Specifically, the server SHALL re-attach the session to the detected `changeName` when EITHER the session has no current `attachedProposal` OR the current `attachedProposal` equals the current `session.name` (i.e. the previous attachment was auto-tracked) AND the detected `changeName` differs from the current `attachedProposal`.

The inner rename guard SHALL match the rule defined in `Idempotent auto-rename on attach`: rename the session when its current name is empty/whitespace OR equals the current `attachedProposal`. When the rename guard does not fire, the server SHALL NOT send a `rename_session` message to the bridge.

#### Scenario: Fresh session — auto-detect attaches and auto-names
- **WHEN** session has `name: undefined`, `attachedProposal: null`, `openspecChange: null`
- **AND** the activity detector emits `{ changeName: "bar", isActive: true }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.attachedProposal = "bar"` and `session.name = "bar"`
- **AND** the server SHALL send `rename_session { name: "bar" }` to the bridge

#### Scenario: Auto-tracked attachment re-attaches when a different changeName is detected
- **WHEN** session has `name: "foo"`, `attachedProposal: "foo"` (auto-tracked from a previous detection)
- **AND** the activity detector emits `{ changeName: "bar", isActive: true }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.attachedProposal = "bar"` and `session.name = "bar"`
- **AND** the server SHALL send `rename_session { name: "bar" }` to the bridge

#### Scenario: User-customised name — openspecChange tracks reality, attachment preserved
- **WHEN** session has `name: "my custom"`, `attachedProposal: "foo"`, `openspecChange: "foo"`
- **AND** the activity detector emits `{ changeName: "bar", isActive: true }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL update `session.openspecChange = "bar"` (so the activity badge tracks reality)
- **AND** `session.attachedProposal` SHALL remain `"foo"` (user has overridden the auto-tracking)
- **AND** `session.name` SHALL remain `"my custom"`
- **AND** no `rename_session` SHALL be sent to the bridge

#### Scenario: Already-converged state — no redundant rename
- **WHEN** session has `name: "bar"`, `attachedProposal: "bar"`, `openspecChange: "bar"`
- **AND** the activity detector emits `{ changeName: "bar", isActive: true }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT send `rename_session` to the bridge
- **AND** the broadcast `session_updated` payload SHALL NOT include a `name` field for this update (no redundant rebroadcast)
