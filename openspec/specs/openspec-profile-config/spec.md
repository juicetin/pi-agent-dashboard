# openspec-profile-config Specification

## Purpose

Read, write, and apply the global OpenSpec workflow profile from the dashboard: global config write (CLI preset for `core`, atomic JSON for `expanded`/`custom`), per-cwd and bulk `openspec update`, and per-cwd staleness reporting. See change: add-openspec-profile-settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Write global OpenSpec config from the dashboard

The server SHALL expose `POST /api/openspec/config` (localhost-only, behind the existing network guard) that accepts `{ profile: "core" | "expanded" | "custom", workflows: string[] }` and persists it to the global OpenSpec config file (`~/.config/openspec/config.json`).

- When `profile === "core"`, the server SHALL invoke the CLI preset via the `OPENSPEC_CONFIG_PROFILE` recipe (`openspec config profile core`) rather than writing JSON directly.
- When `profile === "expanded"` or `"custom"`, the server SHALL write the config file directly (no CLI preset exists for these), setting `profile` and `workflows` and preserving all other existing keys (`delivery`, `telemetry`, `featureFlags`).
- For the `expanded` option, the server SHALL write `profile: "expanded"` with the expanded workflow set (`propose, explore, new, continue, ff, apply, verify, sync, archive, bulk-archive, onboard`).
- The `delivery` field SHALL be left unchanged (out of scope).
- After a successful write, the server SHALL invalidate its 30s `configCache` so the next `GET /api/openspec/config` returns fresh data.

#### Scenario: Save core profile uses the CLI preset

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ profile: "core", workflows: ["propose","explore","apply","archive"] }`
- **THEN** the server runs `openspec config profile core`
- **AND** returns `{ success: true }`
- **AND** the cached config for affected cwds is invalidated

#### Scenario: Save expanded profile writes JSON with profile "expanded"

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ profile: "expanded", workflows: [...11 workflows] }`
- **THEN** the server writes `~/.config/openspec/config.json` with `profile: "expanded"` and the 11-workflow array
- **AND** preserves the existing `delivery`, `telemetry`, and `featureFlags` keys

#### Scenario: Save custom profile writes the selected subset

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ profile: "custom", workflows: ["propose","apply","archive"] }`
- **THEN** the server writes `profile: "custom"` with exactly those three workflows

### Requirement: Atomic global config write

When writing `~/.config/openspec/config.json` directly, the server SHALL write to a temporary file in the same directory and `rename()` it over the target, so a concurrent reader (CLI or another tool) never observes a partially written file.

#### Scenario: Write is atomic

- **WHEN** the server writes the global config directly
- **THEN** it writes to a temp file then renames it over `config.json`
- **AND** a reader either sees the complete old file or the complete new file, never a partial one

#### Scenario: Write failure leaves the original intact

- **WHEN** the write to the temp file fails
- **THEN** the original `config.json` is unchanged
- **AND** the endpoint returns `{ success: false, error }`

### Requirement: Run openspec update from the dashboard

The server SHALL expose `POST /api/openspec/update` (localhost-only) that runs the `OPENSPEC_UPDATE` recipe (`openspec update`) in a target working directory.

- The body SHALL accept either `{ cwd: string }` for a single project or `{ all: true }` to update every known cwd (union of active session cwds and pinned directories).
- On a successful update for a cwd, the server SHALL record that cwd's current workflow-set signature so staleness can be computed later.
- A failure updating one cwd in the `all` path SHALL NOT abort the remaining cwds; the response SHALL report per-cwd success/failure.

#### Scenario: Update a single project

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ cwd: "/home/user/project" }`
- **THEN** the server runs `openspec update` in that directory
- **AND** records the project's workflow-set signature
- **AND** returns `{ success: true }`

#### Scenario: Update all known projects

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{ all: true }`
- **THEN** the server runs `openspec update` in every known cwd (session cwds + pinned dirs)
- **AND** returns a per-cwd result list
- **AND** one cwd's failure does not prevent the others from being updated

### Requirement: Report per-cwd update staleness

The server SHALL expose `GET /api/openspec/update-status` that returns, for each known cwd, one of `up-to-date`, `needs-update`, or `unknown`.

- "Known cwds" SHALL be the union of active session cwds and pinned directories, **filtered to OpenSpec-initialized projects only** (a `<cwd>/openspec/` directory exists). Directories where `openspec init` has not run SHALL be excluded from both the status list and the update-all target set.
- A cwd is `up-to-date` when its recorded workflow-set signature equals the current global config's workflow-set signature.
- A cwd is `needs-update` when a recorded signature exists but differs from the current one.
- A cwd is `unknown` when no signature has been recorded (the dashboard has never run an update for it).

#### Scenario: Project matching current config is up-to-date

- **WHEN** a cwd's recorded signature equals the current global workflow-set signature
- **THEN** the status for that cwd is `up-to-date`

#### Scenario: Project lagging the current config needs update

- **WHEN** the global profile changed since a cwd was last updated via the dashboard
- **THEN** the status for that cwd is `needs-update`

#### Scenario: Never-updated project is unknown

- **WHEN** the dashboard has no recorded signature for a cwd
- **THEN** the status for that cwd is `unknown`

#### Scenario: Non-initialized directories are excluded

- **WHEN** a known cwd has no `openspec/` directory (`openspec init` never ran)
- **THEN** that cwd does not appear in the update-status list
- **AND** `POST /api/openspec/update { all: true }` does not run `openspec update` there

### Requirement: Saving the profile does not mutate project repositories

A successful `POST /api/openspec/config` SHALL NOT run `openspec update` and SHALL NOT write any file inside a project working directory. Regenerating per-project `/opsx:` skill files SHALL only occur through the explicit update endpoint.

#### Scenario: Save leaves project working trees clean

- **WHEN** a client saves a new profile via `POST /api/openspec/config`
- **THEN** no file inside any project cwd is created or modified
- **AND** only `~/.config/openspec/config.json` (global) changes
