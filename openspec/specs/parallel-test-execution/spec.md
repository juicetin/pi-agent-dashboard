# parallel-test-execution Specification

## Purpose

This capability covers running the vitest suite in parallel across worker forks for materially faster wall-clock time, while isolating per-file shared-state hazards (filesystem HOME, server ports, localStorage) so the run stays green and non-flaky.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Test files execute in parallel across worker forks
The vitest suite SHALL run test files concurrently across multiple worker forks (`maxWorkers > 1`, target `"50%"` of logical cores) rather than one serial worker per project. Parallelism SHALL be enabled per project only after that project's shared-state hazards (filesystem HOME, ports, localStorage) are isolated. The full run SHALL remain green and non-flaky (verified by 3 consecutive passing runs) at each enabled step.

The parallel worker target SHALL be declared in exactly one module and imported by every vitest config that runs in parallel AND declares a worker setting, rather than duplicated as a literal per package. A project that deliberately runs serially SHALL state `maxWorkers: 1` explicitly and SHALL NOT import the module; the module carries the parallel default, not a mandate on every config. A config that declares NO worker setting (`dashboard-plugin-skill` at adoption) is exempt from the import mandate — vitest's unset default (`numCpus-1`) differs from the target, so adopting there would change its effective count. The module SHALL be positioned so that adopting it introduces no new `package.json` dependency edge for any package. The target value SHALL NOT be derived from observed machine load: a vitest config is evaluated before workers fork, so a load reading taken there cannot observe run-induced contention.

#### Scenario: Pure projects run parallel
- **WHEN** `npm test` runs the `shared`, `extension`, `client-utils`, plugin, and `scripts` projects
- **THEN** their test files SHALL execute across multiple forks
- **AND** the run SHALL pass with no flakes across 3 consecutive runs

#### Scenario: Faster than serial baseline
- **WHEN** the full suite runs with parallelism enabled
- **THEN** wall-clock time SHALL be materially lower than the `maxWorkers: 1` baseline
- **AND** no test SHALL fail due to the change in concurrency

#### Scenario: Worker target has a single source of truth
- **WHEN** a package's vitest config sets a parallel worker target
- **THEN** it SHALL import that value from the shared module
- **AND** no package config SHALL restate the parallel target as a literal

#### Scenario: Adopting the module adds no dependency edge
- **WHEN** a vitest config imports the shared worker module
- **THEN** its package SHALL NOT gain a new entry in its `package.json` dependencies or devDependencies
- **AND** no workspace dependency cycle SHALL be introduced

#### Scenario: Deliberately serial projects stay serial
- **GIVEN** the 7 projects that run serially by design — `electron`, `image-fit-extension`, `kb-extension`, `mockup-loop`, `nano-banana`, `video-production`, `video-transcription`
- **WHEN** the shared module is adopted
- **THEN** each SHALL continue to declare `maxWorkers: 1` explicitly
- **AND** each SHALL NOT import the shared module
- **AND** its effective worker count SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Consolidation changes no effective worker count
- **WHEN** the suite runs before and after the shared module is adopted
- **THEN** every project's effective worker count SHALL be identical
- **AND** CI's worker count SHALL be unchanged

### Requirement: Each test file gets an isolated HOME
A per-file setup hook (`setupFiles`, executed inside each worker fork before the test file's imports) SHALL assign `process.env.HOME` to a unique temporary directory and pre-create `.pi/agent/sessions` and `.pi/dashboard` within it. The existing `globalSetup` tripwire (throws when `HOME` equals the real user home) SHALL remain as a second-line guard.

#### Scenario: Parallel files do not share HOME state
- **WHEN** two server test files that read/write `$HOME/.pi` run in parallel forks
- **THEN** each SHALL operate on its own temporary HOME
- **AND** neither SHALL observe or corrupt the other's `.pi/dashboard` files or locks

#### Scenario: Real user home still protected
- **WHEN** any test runs
- **THEN** `process.env.HOME` SHALL NOT equal the real user home
- **AND** the tripwire SHALL abort the run if it does

### Requirement: Server-boot tests use OS-assigned ports
Tests that boot a real server SHALL bind `port: 0` (OS-assigned) via `createTestServer()` or the `httpPort()`/`piPort()` getters, NOT hardcoded port numbers. No server-boot test SHALL rely on a fixed port literal.

#### Scenario: No port collisions under parallelism
- **WHEN** multiple server-boot test files run in parallel forks
- **THEN** each SHALL bind an OS-assigned port
- **AND** no test SHALL fail with `EADDRINUSE`

#### Scenario: Hardcoded ports rejected
- **WHEN** a server-boot test is added or modified
- **THEN** a guard test SHALL fail if it binds a hardcoded port instead of `port: 0`/`createTestServer()`

### Requirement: localStorage is isolated per fork
Parallel forks SHALL NOT share a single `--localstorage-file`. The per-file setup hook SHALL assign a unique localStorage file per fork (or the suite SHALL otherwise guarantee no two parallel forks write the same localStorage file).

#### Scenario: Parallel forks do not corrupt localStorage
- **WHEN** tests in parallel forks write to localStorage
- **THEN** each fork SHALL use its own localStorage backing
- **AND** no test SHALL observe another fork's localStorage writes

### Requirement: Timeouts and async waits tolerate fork contention
The suite SHALL set test timeouts and async-wait budgets that absorb CPU
oversubscription under parallel forks, so healthy tests do not fail on timing
alone. The server project SHALL set a package-level `testTimeout` well above the
5s default (30s) to cover full-server boots (`vi.resetModules()` + fresh
`import` cold-transforms under `pool:"forks"`), git worktree spawns, and
subprocess probes. The client project SHALL set a package-level `testTimeout`
(15s) and SHALL raise the Testing-Library global `asyncUtilTimeout` (5s) so
`waitFor`/`findBy*` polls do not expire before an effect, mock call, or state
update lands. Tests SHALL assert on polled DOM/mock state (`waitFor`) rather
than a fixed number of macrotask ticks, and SHALL NOT depend on shared
module-level fixtures restored only at a test's end (skipped on throw, which
cascades into unrelated tests).

The prohibition on fixed-tick waits SHALL be machine-enforced by a guard test rather than left to review, and the client suite SHALL contain no violations when the guard lands. A client test file SHALL NOT await a bare `setTimeout` used as an async barrier before a one-shot assertion. A test that genuinely exercises timer behaviour, or that yields inside a mock implementation rather than gating an assertion, MAY opt out with an explicit inline comment naming the reason. The opt-out SHALL apply to the annotated occurrence only, never to the whole file, so a barrier added to that file later is still flagged.

#### Scenario: Boot-heavy server test survives contention
- **WHEN** a server test that boots a full server runs concurrently with the
  rest of the suite across `"50%"` worker forks
- **THEN** it SHALL complete within the package `testTimeout`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT fail with "Test timed out in 5000ms"

#### Scenario: Client async assertion polls instead of guessing ticks
- **WHEN** a jsdom test triggers an async effect (FileReader decode, post-mount
  scroll, fetch-driven render) under fork contention
- **THEN** the assertion SHALL poll via `waitFor`/`findBy*` within
  `asyncUtilTimeout`
- **AND** it SHALL NOT fail with a one-shot `expected … got 0` / "Mock not
  called" race

#### Scenario: Shared fixture cannot cascade a failure
- **WHEN** a test mutates a shared module-level fixture and a sibling test in the
  same file depends on its canonical state
- **THEN** the fixture SHALL be reset in `beforeEach`
- **AND** a throw in one test SHALL NOT leave the fixture dirty for the next

#### Scenario: Fixed-tick barrier is rejected
- **GIVEN** a client test file that awaits a bare `setTimeout` as a barrier before a one-shot assertion
- **WHEN** the guard test runs
- **THEN** it SHALL fail and name the offending file

#### Scenario: Client suite is compliant when the guard lands
- **WHEN** the guard runs against the client suite at the moment this change lands
- **THEN** it SHALL report zero violations
- **AND** it SHALL hard-fail rather than warn

#### Scenario: Mock-internal yield is preserved, not converted
- **GIVEN** `PairLanding.test.tsx`, whose awaited timer sits inside a `postJson` mock so React can commit a render and gates no assertion
- **WHEN** this change lands
- **THEN** that timer SHALL remain in place
- **AND** the test's assertions and coverage SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Deliberate timer use opts out per occurrence
- **GIVEN** a client test that awaits a timer to exercise debounce or throttle behaviour, or that yields inside a mock implementation rather than gating an assertion, and carries an inline opt-out comment naming the reason directly above it
- **WHEN** the guard test runs
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT flag that occurrence

#### Scenario: A file-level opt-out does not waive later violations
- **GIVEN** a client test file containing one annotated opt-out occurrence
- **WHEN** an un-annotated awaited-timer barrier is added elsewhere in the same file
- **THEN** the guard SHALL flag the new occurrence

#### Scenario: FileReader-backed paste assertions poll
- **WHEN** `useImagePaste.test.ts` decodes pasted images through `FileReader`
- **THEN** every assertion on `pendingImages` SHALL poll via `waitFor`
- **AND** the file SHALL pass in the full parallel run across 3 consecutive runs
