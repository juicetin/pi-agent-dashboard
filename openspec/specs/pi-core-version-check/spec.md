# pi-core-version-check Specification

## Purpose
Server-side discovery and reporting of installed pi ecosystem core package versions so the dashboard can surface version skew and upgrade hints.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Core package discovery
The server SHALL discover all installed pi ecosystem core packages from both global npm and the managed install directory (`~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/`).

#### Scenario: Global npm packages discovered
- **WHEN** the server runs `npm list -g --depth=0 --json`
- **THEN** it SHALL parse the output and identify pi ecosystem packages by matching known package names (`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard`, `@blackbelt-technology/pi-model-proxy`) and packages starting with `pi-`
- **AND** each discovered package SHALL include its installed version from the JSON output

#### Scenario: Managed install packages discovered
- **WHEN** the directory `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` exists
- **THEN** the server SHALL scan it for pi ecosystem packages by reading each matching `package.json`
- **AND** mark their `installSource` as `"managed"`

#### Scenario: Managed directory does not exist
- **WHEN** `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` does not exist
- **THEN** the server SHALL skip managed scanning without error
- **AND** only return globally installed packages

#### Scenario: npm list command fails
- **WHEN** `npm list -g --depth=0 --json` fails or times out (30s)
- **THEN** the server SHALL log a warning and return an empty list for global packages

#### Scenario: Duplicate package in both sources
- **WHEN** a package is found in both global npm and managed install
- **THEN** the managed install version SHALL take precedence

### Requirement: Version comparison against registry
The server SHALL compare each discovered package's installed version against the latest version available on npm or GitHub.

#### Scenario: npm package version check
- **WHEN** a discovered package is an npm package
- **THEN** the server SHALL fetch its latest version via `fetchPackageMeta()` from the npm registry
- **AND** set `updateAvailable` to `true` when installed version differs from latest

#### Scenario: Registry unreachable
- **WHEN** the npm registry is unreachable for a package
- **THEN** `latestVersion` SHALL be `null` and `updateAvailable` SHALL be `false`

### Requirement: Version status caching
The server SHALL cache version status results for 5 minutes to avoid excessive registry queries.

#### Scenario: Cached result returned
- **WHEN** a version check was performed less than 5 minutes ago
- **THEN** the cached result SHALL be returned without querying the registry

#### Scenario: Force refresh
- **WHEN** `GET /api/pi-core/versions?refresh=true` is called
- **THEN** the cache SHALL be invalidated and a fresh check SHALL be performed

### Requirement: Version status REST endpoint
The server SHALL expose `GET /api/pi-core/versions` returning `PiCoreStatus` with all discovered packages, their versions, and update availability.

#### Scenario: Successful version check
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /api/pi-core/versions`
- **THEN** the response SHALL contain `{ success: true, data: PiCoreStatus }` with `packages` array, `updatesAvailable` count, and `lastChecked` ISO timestamp

#### Scenario: No packages found
- **WHEN** no pi ecosystem packages are discovered
- **THEN** the response SHALL return an empty `packages` array with `updatesAvailable: 0`

### Requirement: Core package update execution
The server SHALL expose `POST /api/pi-core/update` to update one or more core packages.

#### Scenario: Update global package
- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /api/pi-core/update` with `{ packages: ["@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent"] }` and the package has `installSource: "global"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL run `npm update -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
- **AND** broadcast progress events via WebSocket

#### Scenario: Update managed package
- **WHEN** a package has `installSource: "managed"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL run `npm update <pkg>` in the `~/.pi-dashboard/` directory

#### Scenario: Update all packages
- **WHEN** `POST /api/pi-core/update` is called with `{ packages: [] }` or no `packages` field
- **THEN** all packages with `updateAvailable: true` SHALL be updated sequentially

#### Scenario: Concurrent operation blocked
- **WHEN** a package operation (extension install/update or core update) is already running
- **THEN** the server SHALL return 409 Conflict

#### Scenario: Permission error on global update
- **WHEN** `npm update -g` fails with a permission error
- **THEN** the error message SHALL be surfaced to the client

### Requirement: Session auto-reload after update
The server SHALL auto-reload all connected pi sessions after a successful core package update.

#### Scenario: Successful update triggers reload
- **WHEN** a core package update completes successfully
- **THEN** all connected pi sessions SHALL be reloaded
- **AND** the completion message SHALL include `sessionsReloaded` count

### Requirement: Display name mapping
Known core packages SHALL have human-readable display names.

#### Scenario: Known package has display name
- **WHEN** `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` is discovered
- **THEN** its `displayName` SHALL be `"pi (core agent)"`

#### Scenario: Unknown package uses npm name
- **WHEN** a discovered package has no display name mapping
- **THEN** its npm package name SHALL be used as `displayName`



### Requirement: piCompatibility block tracks current upstream pi-coding-agent

The `packages/server/package.json` `piCompatibility` block SHALL declare a `recommended` version that is no more than one minor release behind the latest published `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and a `minimum` version that matches the version actually exercised in the dashboard's tests and bundled offline cache.

After this change, the values SHALL be:

- `minimum: "0.70.0"`
- `recommended: "0.70.0"`
- `maximum: null`

Note: `minimum` is intentionally pinned in lockstep with `recommended`. The dashboard does NOT maintain backward compatibility for older pi versions — keeping `minimum` at the same value as `recommended` removes the need for any conditional code paths or dual-import shims.

#### Scenario: Recommended version drives the upgrade hint
- **WHEN** the running pi-coding-agent version is below `piCompatibility.recommended`
- **THEN** `bootstrapState.compatibility.upgradeRecommended` is `true`
- **AND** the bootstrap status response is still `status: "ready"` (non-blocking)

#### Scenario: Minimum version drives the blocking error
- **WHEN** the running pi-coding-agent version is below `piCompatibility.minimum`
- **THEN** `bootstrapState.compatibility` includes a 503-blocking `error` message
- **AND** the bootstrap banner renders in the red "below minimum" state

#### Scenario: Maximum is unbounded
- **WHEN** `piCompatibility.maximum` is `null`
- **THEN** no upper-bound block is produced regardless of the running pi version

### Requirement: Offline-cache pin matches recommended pi version

The `packages/electron/offline-packages.json` manifest SHALL pin `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to the same version declared in `piCompatibility.recommended`, so the offline-bundled npm cache and the upgrade hint agree.

#### Scenario: Pin and recommended stay in lockstep
- **WHEN** `piCompatibility.recommended` is bumped in `packages/server/package.json`
- **THEN** `packages/electron/offline-packages.json` SHALL be updated to the same version in the same change

### Requirement: pi-core-updater resolves npm via ToolRegistry and inherits managed Node on PATH

The pi-core-updater SHALL resolve the `npm` binary it spawns through `ToolRegistry.resolve("npm")` rather than invoking a bare `"npm"` command, AND SHALL apply `prependManagedNodeToPath(env)` to the spawned child's environment so that nested `node`/`npm` resolution inside the npm subprocess also picks up the managed runtime.

#### Scenario: Managed-source update uses registry-resolved npm

- **WHEN** `pi-core-updater.ts::defaultRunNpmUpdate` is invoked for a package with `installSource: "managed"`
- **THEN** the spawned binary SHALL be the absolute path returned by `ToolRegistry.resolve("npm")`
- **AND** the spawn SHALL NOT use a bare `"npm"` command name
- **AND** the spawned process's `env.PATH` SHALL contain the managed Node directory as its first entry when `<managedDir>/node/` exists

#### Scenario: Global-source update uses registry-resolved npm

- **WHEN** `pi-core-updater.ts::defaultRunNpmUpdate` is invoked for a package with `installSource: "global"`
- **THEN** the spawned binary SHALL be the absolute path returned by `ToolRegistry.resolve("npm")`
- **AND** the spawned process's `env.PATH` SHALL contain the managed Node directory as its first entry when `<managedDir>/node/` exists

#### Scenario: ToolRegistry resolution failure surfaces a clear error

- **WHEN** `pi-core-updater.ts::defaultRunNpmUpdate` is invoked
- **AND** `ToolRegistry.resolve("npm")` returns no path (no override, no managed runtime, no npm on PATH)
- **THEN** the updater SHALL reject with an error message naming `npm` as unresolved
- **AND** SHALL NOT attempt a bare `spawn("npm", ...)` fallback

#### Scenario: Permission-error hint preserved

- **WHEN** the registry-resolved `npm update -g <pkg>` fails with stderr matching `permission|EACCES|EPERM|EROFS`
- **AND** the package's `installSource` is `"global"`
- **THEN** the rejected error message SHALL include the existing remediation hint suggesting `sudo npm update -g <pkg>`
