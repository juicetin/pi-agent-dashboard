## Purpose

The Pi Resources view is the workspace's content-area surface for browsing every pi-resource (skill, extension, prompt) available to a session — loose files in `<cwd>/.pi/` and `~/.pi/agent/` plus the resources contributed by installed packages — and for managing the workspace's installed packages.

- **THEN** the Pi Resources button SHALL display the updated icon
- **THEN** the button SHALL retain its right-aligned position in the action bar

### Requirement: Resources view shows installed pi resources for a workspace
The PiResourcesView SHALL include a tab bar with "Installed" (existing view) and "Packages" (new) tabs. The "Packages" tab SHALL display the PackageBrowser in local scope, showing installed local packages and allowing search/install/remove/update for the workspace's `.pi/settings.json`.

#### Scenario: Switch to Packages tab
- **WHEN** user clicks the "Packages" tab in PiResourcesView
- **THEN** the PackageBrowser is shown in local scope for the current workspace cwd

#### Scenario: Install local package
- **WHEN** user clicks "Install" on a package in the Packages tab
- **THEN** the package is installed via `POST /api/packages/install` with `scope: "local"` and the workspace cwd

#### Scenario: Default tab is Installed
- **WHEN** user opens PiResourcesView
- **THEN** the "Installed" tab is selected by default showing the existing resources view

### Requirement: Merged scope sections
The Installed tab SHALL show two merged sections: Local (loose resources + local packages) and Global (loose resources + global packages) instead of separate Local/Global/Packages sections.

#### Scenario: View merged Local section
- **WHEN** user views the Installed tab for a workspace with local loose resources and local packages
- **THEN** both are displayed together under a single "Local" section

#### Scenario: View merged Global section
- **WHEN** user views the Installed tab
- **THEN** global loose resources and global packages are displayed together under a single "Global" section

### Requirement: Collapsible resource hierarchy
All sections, resource groups (Skills/Extensions/Prompts), and package items SHALL be collapsible with chevron toggles, defaulting to collapsed. Progressive indentation (16px per depth) SHALL visually distinguish hierarchy levels.

#### Scenario: Collapse a section
- **WHEN** user clicks the chevron toggle on a section header (e.g., "Local")
- **THEN** the section collapses, hiding all nested resource groups and package items

#### Scenario: Default collapsed state
- **WHEN** the Installed tab loads
- **THEN** all sections, resource groups, and package items are collapsed by default

#### Scenario: Visual indentation
- **WHEN** nested items are expanded
- **THEN** each depth level is indented by 16px to visually distinguish the hierarchy

### Requirement: Resources tab SHALL be a pure browse surface

The first tab in `PiResourcesView` SHALL be labeled "Resources" (rendered text). Its purpose SHALL be to browse pi-resource files (skills, extensions, prompts) loose in `<cwd>/.pi/` or `~/.pi/agent/`, plus the resources contributed by each installed package. The tab SHALL NOT render standalone manage rows for installed packages (no "uninstall" buttons, no version pills, no source-type badges at the top level). Per-package nested resource trees SHALL remain (a 📦 collapsible whose children are the Skills/Extensions/Prompts the package contributes).

The internal route id SHALL remain `"installed"` to preserve existing test selectors and route deep-links; only the rendered label and `data-testid`s change.

#### Scenario: Tab label reads "Resources"

- **WHEN** `PiResourcesView` renders its tab bar
- **THEN** the first tab's visible text is `"Resources"` (not `"Installed"`)
- **AND** the second tab's text remains `"Packages"`

#### Scenario: Loose `.pi/` files render under their scope

- **WHEN** `<cwd>/.pi/skills/foo/SKILL.md`, `<cwd>/.pi/extensions/bar.ts`, and `<cwd>/.pi/prompts/baz.md` exist
- **THEN** the Resources tab's "Local" section renders a `Skills (1)` group, an `Extensions (1)` group, and a `Prompts (1)` group
- **AND** each entry is clickable (opens the file in the content area)
- **AND** no entry has an Uninstall button

#### Scenario: Per-package nested resource trees render

- **WHEN** the workspace has `packages: ["npm:pi-flows"]` installed
- **AND** `pi-flows` contributes 4 skills and 2 extensions to the session
- **THEN** the Resources tab's "Local" section renders a 📦 `pi-flows` collapsible
- **AND** expanding it reveals `Skills (4)` and `Extensions (2)` sub-groups
- **AND** clicking an individual skill/extension opens the file (read-only)
- **AND** the 📦 row has no Uninstall button (manage actions live in the Packages tab)

#### Scenario: Installed package with no contributed resources still renders nothing standalone

- **WHEN** the workspace has `packages: ["/abs/path/library-only"]` installed
- **AND** `library-only` contributes zero skills/extensions/prompts
- **THEN** the Resources tab does NOT render a 📦 row for `library-only`
- **AND** the package still appears with full management UI in the Packages tab

### Requirement: Packages tab SHALL be the only workspace-scope manage surface

The Packages tab in `PiResourcesView` SHALL host the workspace-scope install / update / uninstall workflow. It SHALL render `PackageBrowser` with `scope="local"` and `cwd={folderCwd}`. The tab SHALL be discoverable to users who installed a non-npm package and want to remove it (via the Installed Packages section described in the `package-browse` spec).

#### Scenario: Packages tab is the sole workspace-scope uninstall path

- **WHEN** the workspace has a local-path package installed (`/home/me/my-ext`)
- **THEN** the Packages tab's Installed Packages section renders a `PackageRow` for it with an `Uninstall` button
- **AND** the Resources tab does not render a manage row for it
- **AND** clicking `Uninstall` issues `POST /api/packages/remove { source: "/home/me/my-ext", scope: "local", cwd }`

### Requirement: Installed tab renders unified package list
The Pi Resources view's "Installed" (Resources) tab SHALL render packages using the shared `<InstalledPackagesList>` component alongside the loose-resource tree from `<MergedScopeSection>`.

The tab SHALL contain, for each scope (Local and Global), in vertical order:

1. A loose Skills / Extensions / Prompts tree showing resources that exist on disk but are NOT contributed by any installed package (rendered by `<MergedScopeSection>`).
2. A "Packages" sub-heading followed by `<InstalledPackagesList scope=<scope> cwd=<view's cwd or undefined> />`.

The loose section SHALL preserve its tree rendering. The Packages section SHALL render rich rows (`<PackageRow>`) consistent with Settings → Packages.

Each rich row SHALL:

- Display version, update badge, progress, errors, and source-type badge identically to Settings.
- Expose `Update`, `Uninstall`, `View README`, and (when applicable) `Move →` actions.
- Provide an expand-chevron that reveals an inline tree of skills / extensions / prompts contributed by this package, populated from `usePiResources` data via the `containedResources` prop.

#### Scenario: Local packages render as rich rows
- **WHEN** the user opens Pi Resources for `/abs/cwd`
- **AND** `/abs/cwd/.pi/settings.json` lists 2 packages
- **THEN** the Local section's "Packages" sub-heading SHALL be followed by an `<InstalledPackagesList scope="local" cwd="/abs/cwd">` rendering 2 rich rows
- **AND** each row SHALL show version, update badge, and the action buttons

#### Scenario: Loose resources still render as tree
- **GIVEN** `/abs/cwd/.pi/skills/foo/SKILL.md` exists but `foo` is not contributed by any installed package
- **THEN** the Local section's loose Skills group SHALL list `foo`
- **AND** `foo` SHALL NOT appear inside any package row's expand tree

#### Scenario: Expanding a package reveals contained resources
- **GIVEN** `pi-flows` package contributes 1 skill, 2 extensions, 1 prompt
- **WHEN** the user clicks the row's expand chevron
- **THEN** an inline tree SHALL render listing those 4 resources, grouped by type
- **AND** clicking a leaf SHALL navigate to the resource's file preview

### Requirement: Installed tab move action wires to /api/packages/move
Each package row in the Pi Resources Installed tab SHALL display a `Move →` menu action in addition to existing actions, except when the destination scope already contains the same package identity (in which case the action SHALL be disabled with an explanatory tooltip).

When activated:

- A row in the **Local** list SHALL invoke `move(entry, { fromScope: "local", fromCwd: <view's cwd>, toScope: "global" })` with no further user input.
- A row in the **Global** list SHALL invoke `move(entry, { fromScope: "global", toScope: "local", toCwd: <view's cwd> })` because the cwd is implicit from the surface.

#### Scenario: Move from Local to Global
- **GIVEN** `npm:pi-flows` is installed at scope=local in `/abs/cwd`
- **WHEN** the user clicks `Move → Global` on its row
- **THEN** the client POSTs `/api/packages/move` with `{ entry: <full entry from local settings>, fromScope: "local", fromCwd: "/abs/cwd", toScope: "global" }`
- **AND** the row shows a single composite progress affordance tied to the returned `moveId`
- **AND** on success the row disappears from the Local list and appears in the Global list

#### Scenario: Move from Global to Local
- **WHEN** the user clicks `Move → Local` on a row in the Global list
- **THEN** the client POSTs `/api/packages/move` with `toScope: "local", toCwd: <view's cwd>`
- **AND** no folder picker is shown (cwd is implicit from the surface)

#### Scenario: Move disabled when already at destination
- **GIVEN** `npm:pi-flows` is installed at both scopes
- **WHEN** the row renders in the Local list
- **THEN** the `Move → Global` button SHALL be disabled
- **AND** its tooltip SHALL read `Already installed in global scope`
