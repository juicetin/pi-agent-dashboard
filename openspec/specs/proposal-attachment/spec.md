## Purpose

Persistent per-session proposal focus with attach/detach, server-side auto-attach from activity detection, and auto-naming of sessions from the attached proposal.
## Requirements
### Requirement: AttachedProposal field on DashboardSession
The `DashboardSession` type SHALL include an optional `attachedProposal?: string | null` field representing the currently focused OpenSpec change name for this session.

#### Scenario: Session with attached proposal
- **WHEN** a session has `attachedProposal` set to `"add-auth"`
- **THEN** the OpenSpec section SHALL show only the `"add-auth"` change

#### Scenario: Session without attached proposal
- **WHEN** a session has `attachedProposal` undefined or null
- **THEN** the OpenSpec section SHALL show all changes

### Requirement: Manual attach via browser
The browser SHALL send an `attach_proposal` message to attach a proposal to a session. The server SHALL set `session.attachedProposal` to the given `changeName` and broadcast a `session_updated` message. Attach is triggered via a combo box dropdown on the session card instead of per-change "Attach" buttons.

#### Scenario: User selects change from combo box
- **WHEN** the user selects `"add-auth"` from the attach combo box on session `"s1"`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal", sessionId: "s1", changeName: "add-auth" }`
- **AND** the server SHALL set `session.attachedProposal = "add-auth"` and broadcast the update

### Requirement: Manual detach via browser
The browser SHALL send a `detach_proposal` message to clear the attached proposal. The server SHALL set `session.attachedProposal` to null, clear `openspecPhase` and `openspecChange` to null, and broadcast a `session_updated` message. The session name SHALL NOT be reverted.

#### Scenario: User clicks Detach
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Detach" button on session `"s1"`
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send `{ type: "detach_proposal", sessionId: "s1" }`
- **AND** the server SHALL set `session.attachedProposal = null`, `session.openspecPhase = null`, `session.openspecChange = null` and broadcast the update
- **AND** the session name SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Re-detection after detach
- **WHEN** a proposal is detached from a session
- **AND** the session later receives new `openspec_activity_update` messages with both phase and changeName
- **THEN** the server SHALL auto-attach the newly detected change

### Requirement: DetectedActivity includes active flag
The `DetectedActivity` interface SHALL include an `isActive` boolean field that indicates whether the detected activity represents an active operation (write, CLI command) or a passive operation (read). Read operations return `isActive: false`, write and bash/CLI operations return `isActive: true`. Phase-only detections (SKILL.md reads) omit `isActive`.

#### Scenario: Read operation returns isActive false
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool "read" and a path matching `openspec/changes/<name>/`
- **THEN** the result SHALL include `isActive: false`

#### Scenario: Write operation returns isActive true
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool "write" and a path matching `openspec/changes/<name>/`
- **THEN** the result SHALL include `isActive: true`

#### Scenario: Bash CLI command returns isActive true
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool "bash" and a command containing an openspec CLI invocation with a change name
- **THEN** the result SHALL include `isActive: true`

#### Scenario: Phase-only detection omits isActive
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with a SKILL.md read (phase detection only, no changeName)
- **THEN** the result SHALL NOT include `isActive`

### Requirement: Server-side auto-attach from activity detection

When the server receives `openspec_activity_update` messages, it SHALL
update the session's `openspecPhase` and `openspecChange` fields
independently, subject to the locality gate: a detected `changeName` that
the gate rejects SHALL NOT be written to `openspecChange` and SHALL NOT
enter the branch logic below. After each permitted update, the server
SHALL apply the following branch logic when `openspecChange` is set and
the detected activity has `isActive: true`:

1. **No attachment** (`attachedProposal` is null/undefined): set
   `attachedProposal = openspecChange` (auto-attach).
2. **Auto-tracked attachment** (the witness rule
   `isNameAutoSetFromAttachment` returns true) AND a different
   `changeName`: set `attachedProposal = openspecChange` and apply
   auto-rename (silent re-attach, mirrors prior behaviour).
3. **Manual attachment, attached proposal still exists**, and
   `changeName !== attachedProposal` and
   `changeName !== pendingReplaceProposal` and `changeName ∉
   rejectedReplaceProposals`: set
   `pendingReplaceProposal = changeName` (surface the conflict via
   the dialog).
4. **Manual attachment, attached proposal no longer exists in the poll
   cache of any candidate root**: treat as case 1 (auto-attach the new
   `changeName`). Existence for this branch SHALL be resolved over the
   same candidate roots as the locality gate (session `cwd` plus
   worktree main path), and SHALL retain its permissive disposition on
   an unknown cache — an unknown root means the attachment is treated as
   still existing. The roots consulted are the CONCRETE ones only (session
   `cwd` plus worktree main path when present); the unknown root that the
   locality gate adds for a session whose worktree state is unresolved SHALL
   NOT participate here, because it would make the attachment permanently
   "still existing" for every unreported session and suppress this branch
   entirely.

Read-only operations (`isActive: false`) SHALL update tracking fields
but SHALL NOT trigger any of the above branches. Read-only operations
remain subject to the locality gate for the `openspecChange` stamp.

#### Scenario: Branch 1 — auto-attach on first active event

- **WHEN** `attachedProposal = null` AND active event for `"B"`
- **AND** the locality gate permits `"B"`
- **THEN** server sets `attachedProposal = "B"`

#### Scenario: Branch 2 — silent re-attach on auto-tracked

- **WHEN** `attachedProposal = "A"` AND `name === "A"` (auto-tracked) AND active event for `"B"`
- **AND** the locality gate permits `"B"`
- **THEN** server sets `attachedProposal = "B"` and applies auto-rename

#### Scenario: Branch 3 — manual attachment surfaces dialog

- **WHEN** `attachedProposal = "A"` (manual, name differs) AND active event for `"B"`
- **AND** the locality gate permits `"B"`
- **AND** `"B" !== pendingReplaceProposal` AND `"B" ∉ rejectedReplaceProposals`
- **THEN** server sets `pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`
- **AND** `attachedProposal` remains `"A"`

#### Scenario: Branch 4 — manual attachment to deleted proposal

- **WHEN** `attachedProposal = "A"` AND `"A"` is not in the OpenSpec poll cache of any candidate root
- **AND** active event for `"B"`
- **AND** the locality gate permits `"B"`
- **THEN** server sets `attachedProposal = "B"` directly (no dialog)

#### Scenario: Branch 4 — worktree attachment to a main-only change is not treated as deleted

- **WHEN** a session with `cwd = "/repo-a/.worktrees/os-c-a"` and `gitWorktree.mainPath = "/repo-a"` is manually attached to `"c-a"`
- **AND** the worktree cwd cache is initialized and does not list `"c-a"`
- **AND** the cache for `/repo-a` lists `"c-a"`
- **AND** an active event detects a different change `"c-b"`
- **THEN** the attachment SHALL NOT be treated as deleted
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT silently re-attach to `"c-b"`
- **AND** branch 3 SHALL apply instead, setting `pendingReplaceProposal = "c-b"`

#### Scenario: Locality gate short-circuits the branch logic

- **WHEN** an active event detects `"B"` AND the locality gate rejects `"B"`
- **THEN** `openspecChange` SHALL remain unchanged
- **AND** none of branches 1-4 SHALL execute
- **AND** `pendingReplaceProposal` SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement: Case-insensitive tool name matching in activity detector
The `detectOpenSpecActivity` function SHALL match tool names case-insensitively. Pi emits lowercase tool names (`"read"`, `"bash"`, `"write"`) and the detector SHALL handle any casing.

#### Scenario: Lowercase tool name from pi
- **WHEN** a `tool_execution_start` event arrives with `toolName: "read"` and a path matching an openspec skill file
- **THEN** the detector SHALL return the detected phase

#### Scenario: Capitalized tool name
- **WHEN** a `tool_execution_start` event arrives with `toolName: "Read"` and a path matching an openspec change file
- **THEN** the detector SHALL return the detected change name

#### Scenario: Lowercase bash with openspec CLI command
- **WHEN** a `tool_execution_start` event arrives with `toolName: "bash"` and a command containing `openspec status --change "add-auth"`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL return `{ changeName: "add-auth" }`

### Requirement: Detect change name from openspec new change command

The activity detector SHALL detect the change name from `openspec new change "name"` commands using positional arguments, not just the `--change` flag pattern. Detection SHALL be suppressed when the command relocates the working directory to a path outside the session `cwd` anywhere in the command string, regardless of whether the relocation appears before or after the OpenSpec invocation.

#### Scenario: openspec new change with quoted name
- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `openspec new change "add-auth"`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL return `{ changeName: "add-auth" }`

#### Scenario: openspec new change with unquoted name
- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `openspec new change add-auth`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL return `{ changeName: "add-auth" }`

#### Scenario: command that changes directory outside the session cwd is not detected

- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `cd /repo-b && openspec new change add-auth`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL NOT return a change name

#### Scenario: outside relocation after the invocation is also suppressed

- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `openspec new change add-auth && cd /repo-b`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL NOT return a change name

#### Scenario: command that changes directory within the session cwd is detected

- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `cd /repo-a/packages/server && openspec new change add-auth`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL return `{ changeName: "add-auth" }`

### Requirement: Auto-name session on attach
When a proposal is attached (manually or automatically) and the session's `name` field is empty/undefined, the server SHALL set `session.name` to the proposal name and send a `rename_session` message to the extension so pi's internal session name is updated.

#### Scenario: Auto-name on attach when name is empty
- **WHEN** a proposal `"add-auth"` is attached to a session with `name = undefined`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `session.name = "add-auth"` and send `rename_session` to the extension

#### Scenario: No auto-name when name already set
- **WHEN** a proposal `"add-auth"` is attached to a session with `name = "my custom name"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT change `session.name`

#### Scenario: Detach does not revert name
- **WHEN** a proposal is detached from a session that was auto-named
- **THEN** the session name SHALL remain as the proposal name (not reverted)

### Requirement: Activity detector rejects flag-shaped change names
`detectOpenSpecActivity` SHALL NOT return a `changeName` whose first character is `-`. This requirement is now implemented as a strict subset of the slug-shape rule (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`): a leading `-` fails the `[a-z]` first-character class. The implementation SHALL collapse both checks into a single call to `isValidOpenSpecChangeSlug`. The behavior described below remains binding for compatibility with prior fixtures.

#### Scenario: openspec archive --help is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `"openspec archive --help"`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: openspec new change --help is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `"openspec new change --help"`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: --change flag followed by another flag is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `"openspec foo --change --help"`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Real change names are still extracted
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `"openspec archive add-auth"`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `{ changeName: "add-auth", isActive: true }`

#### Scenario: Quoted change names are still extracted
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `'openspec archive "add-auth"'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `{ changeName: "add-auth", isActive: true }`

### Requirement: Content-window header surfaces attached-proposal artifact summary

The content-window header (rendered by `SessionHeader.tsx`, both the desktop branch and the `MobileHeader` sub-component) SHALL surface a glanceable summary of the attached OpenSpec change's lifecycle whenever `session.attachedProposal` is set AND a matching entry exists in the polled `openspecChanges` list.

The summary SHALL consist of:

1. The existing paperclip + change-name chip (unchanged).
2. An artifact-letters pill (the existing `ArtifactLettersButton` from `openspec-helpers.tsx`) rendering one letter per artifact (`P`, `D`, `T`, `S`) colored by the artifact's `status` field (green=`done`, yellow=`ready`, muted=`missing` or unknown). The whole pill SHALL be a single button that opens the `proposal` artifact for the attached change.
3. A task counter `(completedTasks/totalTasks)` rendered immediately after the pill, only when `totalTasks > 0`.

When `session.attachedProposal` is set but no matching entry exists in `openspecChanges` (e.g. polling lag, just-attached state), the header SHALL render only the chip text and SHALL NOT render the pill or counter — preserving the pre-change behavior as the graceful degraded state.

The auto-detected `session.openspecChange` field SHALL NOT trigger this summary; the surface is reserved for the explicit user attach.

#### Scenario: Desktop header renders pill and counter for an attached change with task progress

- **GIVEN** a desktop session with `attachedProposal: "foo"`
- **AND** `openspecChanges` includes `{ name: "foo", artifacts: [{id:"proposal",status:"done"}, {id:"design",status:"ready"}, {id:"tasks",status:"missing"}, {id:"specs",status:"missing"}], completedTasks: 3, totalTasks: 12 }`
- **WHEN** `SessionHeader` is rendered
- **THEN** the desktop branch SHALL contain the chip text `"foo"`, the `artifact-letters-btn` pill, and a `(3/12)` counter

#### Scenario: Mobile header co-locates the pill inside the existing attached chip span

- **GIVEN** a mobile session with `attachedProposal: "foo"` and the same `openspecChanges` fixture as above
- **WHEN** `SessionHeader` is rendered
- **THEN** the `mobile-header-attached-chip` span SHALL contain both the change-name text and the `artifact-letters-btn` pill as descendants
- **AND** the counter `(3/12)` SHALL also appear inside or immediately adjacent to the chip

#### Scenario: Pill click opens the proposal artifact

- **GIVEN** a header with the artifact-letters pill rendered
- **WHEN** the user clicks the pill
- **THEN** `onReadArtifact` SHALL be invoked with `(changeName, "proposal")`

#### Scenario: Missing change in polled list — chip renders without pill

- **GIVEN** a session with `attachedProposal: "foo"` but `openspecChanges = []`
- **WHEN** `SessionHeader` is rendered
- **THEN** the chip text `"foo"` SHALL render
- **AND** no `artifact-letters-btn` element SHALL appear in the document
- **AND** no counter element SHALL appear in the document

#### Scenario: Counter is hidden when totalTasks is zero

- **GIVEN** a session with `attachedProposal: "foo"` and a matching change whose `totalTasks` is `0`
- **WHEN** `SessionHeader` is rendered
- **THEN** the artifact-letters pill SHALL render (subject to `artifacts.length > 0`)
- **AND** no counter text SHALL appear

#### Scenario: Auto-detected openspecChange does not trigger the summary

- **GIVEN** a session with `attachedProposal: null` and `openspecChange: "foo"` (auto-detected activity)
- **AND** `openspecChanges` contains a matching `"foo"` entry with artifacts and tasks
- **WHEN** `SessionHeader` is rendered
- **THEN** no `artifact-letters-btn` element SHALL appear in the header
- **AND** no counter element SHALL appear in the header
- **AND** the existing chip MUST NOT appear (since `attachedProposal` is null)

### Requirement: SessionHeader accepts an artifact-reader callback

The `SessionHeader` component SHALL accept an optional `onReadArtifact?: (changeName: string, artifactId: string) => void` prop. When provided, it SHALL be wired into the artifact-letters pill rendered inside the attached-proposal summary on both desktop and mobile branches. The dashboard root (`App.tsx`) SHALL pass the existing `useContentViews` artifact-reader callback as this prop so the pill opens the same in-content artifact reader used by `FolderOpenSpecSection` and `SessionOpenSpecActions`.

#### Scenario: App threads the callback into SessionHeader

- **GIVEN** the dashboard renders `<SessionHeader>` for the currently selected session
- **WHEN** the user clicks the artifact-letters pill in the header
- **THEN** the same artifact-reader content view SHALL open as when the user clicks the pill in `FolderOpenSpecSection`

### Requirement: Activity detector rejects non-slug change names
`detectOpenSpecActivity` SHALL only return a `DetectedActivity` with a `changeName` when the captured token matches the OpenSpec change-slug shape: lowercase, must start with a letter, kebab-case allowed, max 64 characters (regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`). When a path-based regex (`openspec/changes/<name>/...`) or a CLI regex (`openspec archive`, `openspec new change`, `--change`) captures a token failing this shape, the function SHALL return `null` (for path/CLI captures whose only useful output is `changeName`) or omit `changeName` from the result.

This subsumes the existing `-`-prefix guard: a leading `-` already fails the `[a-z]` first-character rule. The shape predicate SHALL be exposed as `isValidOpenSpecChangeSlug(name: string): boolean` from the same module so other server code can reuse it.

#### Scenario: UUID-shaped path is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"write"` and `path: "openspec/changes/019df0aa-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678/proposal.md"`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: UUID-shaped CLI argument is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `'openspec archive 019df0aa-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Uppercase change name is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"read"` and `path: "openspec/changes/AddAuth/proposal.md"`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Underscore-containing token is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `'openspec archive add_auth'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Digit-prefixed token is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `'openspec archive 1bad'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Token exceeding length cap is ignored
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with a `changeName` candidate longer than 64 characters
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `null`

#### Scenario: Valid kebab-case slug is still extracted
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `'openspec archive add-auth'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `{ changeName: "add-auth", isActive: true }`

#### Scenario: Valid slug with digits is still extracted
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` is called with tool `"bash"` and command `'openspec archive valid-name-123'`
- **THEN** the result SHALL be `{ changeName: "valid-name-123", isActive: true }`

### Requirement: Auto-attach branch re-validates change-name shape
The server's auto-attach branch in `event-wiring.ts` SHALL re-validate `detected.changeName` against `isValidOpenSpecChangeSlug` before stamping `session.openspecChange`, setting `session.attachedProposal`, or sending `rename_session`. When the predicate returns `false`, the auto-attach branch SHALL skip all three mutations for that event. This is intentional defense-in-depth so a future detector regression cannot rename a session to junk.

User-initiated attach paths (`handleAttachProposal`, REST `POST /api/session/:id/attach-proposal`) operate on names from a server-curated list and SHALL NOT add this re-validation.

#### Scenario: Detector returns valid slug — auto-attach proceeds
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` returns `{ changeName: "add-auth", isActive: true }` for a session with `attachedProposal = null` and `name` empty
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `session.openspecChange = "add-auth"`, `session.attachedProposal = "add-auth"`, send `rename_session{ name: "add-auth" }`, and broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Future detector regression returns junk — rename site refuses
- **WHEN** `detectOpenSpecActivity` returns `{ changeName: "019df0aa-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678", isActive: true }` for a session with `attachedProposal = null` and `name` empty (simulating a detector bug)
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT mutate `session.openspecChange`, `session.attachedProposal`, or `session.name`, and SHALL NOT send `rename_session`

#### Scenario: Manual attach via browser is unaffected
- **WHEN** the browser sends `{ type: "attach_proposal", sessionId: "s1", changeName: "AnyShape" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `session.attachedProposal = "AnyShape"` exactly as today, with no slug-shape validation

### Requirement: PendingReplaceProposal field on DashboardSession

The `DashboardSession` type SHALL include an optional
`pendingReplaceProposal?: string | null` field representing a
server-suggested replacement for a manually-attached proposal that the
user has not yet accepted or dismissed. When non-null AND
`attachedProposal` is also non-null, the client SHALL render a
replace-proposal dialog.

#### Scenario: Server sets pending replacement

- **WHEN** a session has `attachedProposal = "A"` (manually attached)
- **AND** the server detects an active OpenSpec operation with `changeName: "B"`
- **AND** `"B"` is not in `rejectedReplaceProposals`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `session.pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`
- **AND** broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Client renders dialog from field

- **WHEN** a session has `attachedProposal = "A"` AND `pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`
- **THEN** the client SHALL render the replace-proposal dialog
- **AND** the dialog's commit target SHALL initialise to `"B"`

### Requirement: RejectedReplaceProposals field on DashboardSession

The `DashboardSession` type SHALL include an optional
`rejectedReplaceProposals?: string[]` field tracking changeNames the
user has dismissed during the current LLM activity loop.

#### Scenario: Dismissal records rejection

- **WHEN** the client sends `dismiss_replace_proposal { sessionId, changeName: "B" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL append `"B"` to `session.rejectedReplaceProposals` (deduplicated)
- **AND** clear `session.pendingReplaceProposal`
- **AND** broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Rejected name does not re-prompt

- **WHEN** `session.rejectedReplaceProposals` contains `"B"`
- **AND** the server detects an active OpenSpec operation with `changeName: "B"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT set `pendingReplaceProposal`
- **AND** SHALL NOT broadcast a session update for this event

### Requirement: Pending replacement coalesces by latest

The server SHALL coalesce pending replacement suggestions into a single
slot: when `pendingReplaceProposal` is already set and a newer event
arrives for a *different* changeName (not in
`rejectedReplaceProposals`), the server SHALL overwrite
`pendingReplaceProposal` with the newer name and broadcast
`session_updated`. The server SHALL NOT queue multiple pending
suggestions.

#### Scenario: Newer event overwrites pending

- **WHEN** `session.pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`
- **AND** the server detects an active operation with `changeName: "C"`
- **AND** `"C"` is not in `rejectedReplaceProposals`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `session.pendingReplaceProposal = "C"`
- **AND** broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Same name does not re-broadcast

- **WHEN** `session.pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`
- **AND** the server detects an active operation with `changeName: "B"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT change `pendingReplaceProposal`
- **AND** SHALL NOT broadcast a session update for this event

### Requirement: Accept replace proposal commits attachment

The browser SHALL send `accept_replace_proposal { sessionId, changeName }`
to commit a replacement. The server SHALL set `attachedProposal =
changeName`, run the existing auto-rename path
(`attachRenameTarget`), broadcast `rename_session` to the pi gateway
when the rename target is non-null, clear `pendingReplaceProposal`,
and broadcast `session_updated`.

#### Scenario: Accept commits and renames

- **WHEN** the client sends `accept_replace_proposal { sessionId: "s1", changeName: "B" }`
- **AND** session `"s1"` has `attachedProposal = "A"` and `pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `attachedProposal = "B"`
- **AND** apply auto-rename via `attachRenameTarget`
- **AND** clear `pendingReplaceProposal`
- **AND** broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Accept does not record rejection

- **WHEN** the client accepts a replacement
- **THEN** the accepted `changeName` SHALL NOT be added to `rejectedReplaceProposals`

### Requirement: Client commit target is independent of server suggestion

The client replace-proposal dialog SHALL maintain a local
`committedTarget` state initialised from the *first*
`pendingReplaceProposal` value it observed when mounting. Subsequent
server updates to `pendingReplaceProposal` SHALL NOT mutate
`committedTarget` automatically.

#### Scenario: Button reflects committed target, not latest suggestion

- **WHEN** the dialog mounts with `pendingReplaceProposal = "B"` (so committed = `"B"`)
- **AND** the server later updates `pendingReplaceProposal` to `"C"`
- **THEN** the dialog's primary button SHALL still read "Replace with B"
- **AND** clicking it SHALL send `accept_replace_proposal { changeName: "B" }`

#### Scenario: Divergence shows banner

- **WHEN** `committedTarget = "B"` AND server `pendingReplaceProposal = "C"`
- **THEN** the dialog SHALL render a banner identifying `"C"` as a newer suggestion
- **AND** the banner SHALL include a `[Use latest]` action

#### Scenario: Use-latest action moves the commit target

- **WHEN** the user clicks `[Use latest]` while the banner is visible
- **THEN** `committedTarget` SHALL be set to the current `pendingReplaceProposal`
- **AND** the banner SHALL hide
- **AND** the primary button label SHALL update to reflect the new committed target

### Requirement: Agent end clears pending and rejected sets

The server SHALL clear both `pendingReplaceProposal` and
`rejectedReplaceProposals` when processing an `agent_end` event for
a session (in addition to clearing `openspecPhase` and
`openspecChange`) and SHALL broadcast the resulting `session_updated`.

#### Scenario: Agent end resets rejection memory

- **WHEN** `session.rejectedReplaceProposals = ["B"]`
- **AND** an `agent_end` event is processed for the session
- **THEN** the server SHALL clear `rejectedReplaceProposals`
- **AND** a subsequent active operation with `changeName: "B"` SHALL set `pendingReplaceProposal = "B"`

### Requirement: Deleted attached proposal bypasses dialog

The server SHALL bypass the replace-proposal dialog when a session's
`attachedProposal` references a change not present in the current
OpenSpec poll cache (archived or deleted): in that case it SHALL
treat the session as having no attachment for the purposes of
activity-driven attach and SHALL auto-attach the new detected
`changeName` directly via the existing auto-attach path without
setting `pendingReplaceProposal`.

#### Scenario: Attached proposal archived, new event auto-attaches

- **WHEN** `session.attachedProposal = "A"` AND `"A"` is not in the OpenSpec poll cache
- **AND** the server detects an active operation with `changeName: "B"`
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `attachedProposal = "B"` directly
- **AND** SHALL NOT set `pendingReplaceProposal`

### Requirement: Server propagates attach/detach to the owning bridge

When `applyAttachProposal(sessionId, changeName, ctx)` mutates `session.attachedProposal`, the server SHALL also dispatch an `attach_proposal_changed { sessionId, attachedChange: <changeName | null> }` message through `pi-gateway` to the bridge currently owning that `sessionId`. This SHALL happen on every code path that funnels through `applyAttachProposal`, including:

- WebSocket `attach_proposal` handler in `session-meta-handler.ts`
- WebSocket `detach_proposal` handler in `session-meta-handler.ts`
- REST attach/detach endpoints (which already reuse `applyAttachProposal`)
- `pendingAttachRegistry.consume(cwd)` resolution at first `session_register`
- Any future caller of `applyAttachProposal` (single seam)

If no bridge is currently connected for `sessionId`, the dispatch SHALL be a silent no-op (state remains in `session.attachedProposal` and is replayed on next `session_register`).

#### Scenario: WS attach pushes message to bridge

- **WHEN** a browser sends `{ type: "attach_proposal", sessionId: "S1", changeName: "X" }`
- **AND** a bridge for `S1` is connected to `pi-gateway`
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId: "S1", attachedChange: "X" }` to that bridge
- **AND** the existing `session_updated` browser broadcast SHALL still occur

#### Scenario: WS detach pushes null to bridge

- **WHEN** a browser sends `{ type: "detach_proposal", sessionId: "S1" }`
- **AND** a bridge for `S1` is connected
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId: "S1", attachedChange: null }` to that bridge

#### Scenario: pendingAttachRegistry consume on spawn pushes to fresh bridge

- **WHEN** a bridge for cwd `C` first calls `session_register` and `pendingAttachRegistry.consume(C)` returns `"X"`
- **THEN** `applyAttachProposal(sessionId, "X", ctx)` runs
- **AND** the server SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId, attachedChange: "X" }` to that newly-registered bridge

#### Scenario: No connected bridge — dispatch is silent no-op

- **WHEN** a browser sends `{ type: "attach_proposal", sessionId: "S1", changeName: "X" }`
- **AND** no bridge for `S1` is currently connected
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT throw and SHALL NOT log an error
- **AND** `session.attachedProposal === "X"` after the call

### Requirement: Server replays current attachedProposal on session_register

`pi-gateway.onSessionRegistered(sessionId, cwd)` SHALL, after the existing `pendingAttachRegistry.consume` step (and only when that step did NOT fire), look up the in-memory `DashboardSession` for `sessionId` and send `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId, attachedChange }` to the bridge, where `attachedChange` is `session.attachedProposal` when it is a non-empty string, else `null`.

The explicit `null` replay is REQUIRED so a reattaching bridge with a stale persisted `attachedChange` is cleared: a detach that occurred while no bridge owned the session no-oped its push, so reattach is the only opportunity to clear it.

The replay SHALL run synchronously within the `onSessionRegistered` hook, before the bridge can submit its first user prompt for the registered session.

#### Scenario: Bridge reattach after dashboard restart receives current attached state

- **GIVEN** session `"S1"` had `attachedProposal === "X"` before dashboard restart
- **WHEN** the bridge reconnects and `session_register` fires for `S1`
- **AND** `pendingAttachRegistry.consume(cwd)` returns `null` (no pending intent)
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId: "S1", attachedChange: "X" }` to the reattaching bridge

#### Scenario: Replay clears bridge state when session has no attached proposal

- **GIVEN** session `"S1"` has `attachedProposal === null`
- **WHEN** the bridge `session_register` fires
- **AND** `pendingAttachRegistry.consume(cwd)` returns `null`
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ type: "attach_proposal_changed", sessionId: "S1", attachedChange: null }` to clear any stale bridge-side attachment

#### Scenario: No replay for an unknown session

- **WHEN** `session_register` fires for a `sessionId` with no in-memory `DashboardSession`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT send any `attach_proposal_changed`

#### Scenario: Spawn-with-attach uses registry path, not replay path

- **GIVEN** the browser sent `spawn_session { cwd: "C", attachProposal: "X" }`, enqueueing into `pendingAttachRegistry`
- **WHEN** the new bridge's first `session_register` fires for `C`
- **THEN** `pendingAttachRegistry.consume("C")` returns `"X"` and triggers `applyAttachProposal` (which pushes `attach_proposal_changed`)
- **AND** the replay branch SHALL NOT fire (it is gated on the consume result), so exactly one `attach_proposal_changed` is sent for the register

### Requirement: Auto-attach locality gate

The server SHALL NOT auto-attach a session to a detected OpenSpec change, and SHALL NOT stamp `openspecChange`, unless that change is resolvable within the session's own project. Resolution consults the in-memory OpenSpec poll cache for a set of candidate roots and SHALL NOT trigger a fresh poll.

The candidate roots for a session are its `cwd` and, when present, its `gitWorktree.mainPath`. A change SHALL be treated as local when it appears in the cached change list of any candidate root.

Because worktree state is reported asynchronously by the bridge rather than at registration, the session SHALL carry an explicit `gitWorktreeReported` indicator, set whenever the bridge supplies worktree state at all — including when it reports that the session is **not** a worktree. The indicator SHALL NOT be inferred from the presence or absence of worktree information alone, because a session that is genuinely not a worktree and a session that has not yet reported are otherwise indistinguishable in session state. The indicator is server-internal and SHALL NOT be broadcast to clients.

A session SHALL be considered **worktree-resolved** when its `gitWorktreeReported` indicator is set, OR when it is known not to be a git repository. The second condition is required because a session whose directory is not a git repository never receives a worktree report at all, and would otherwise remain unresolved for its entire lifetime.

Candidate roots SHALL be composed from two independent rules:

- worktree main path, when present, SHALL always contribute a candidate root, regardless of whether the session is worktree-resolved;
- a session that is NOT worktree-resolved SHALL additionally contribute a root of unknown state, so that it is not rejected while its worktree state is still unknown.

This gate applies only to automatic inference. Manual attach paths (browser `attach_proposal` handler and `POST /api/session/:id/attach-proposal`) are unaffected and continue to accept any name from the server-curated list.

#### Scenario: Detected change absent from the session project is rejected

- **WHEN** a session with `cwd = "/repo-a"` produces an active detection for change `"c-b"`
- **AND** the poll cache for `/repo-a` is initialized and does not list `"c-b"`
- **AND** the session has no `gitWorktree.mainPath`
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT set `attachedProposal`
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT set `openspecChange`
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT apply auto-rename

#### Scenario: Detected change present in the session cwd is accepted

- **WHEN** a session with `cwd = "/repo-a"` produces an active detection for change `"c-a"`
- **AND** the poll cache for `/repo-a` lists `"c-a"`
- **THEN** the auto-attach branch logic SHALL proceed unchanged

#### Scenario: Worktree session resolves against the main checkout

- **WHEN** a session with `cwd = "/repo-a/.worktrees/os-c-a"` and `gitWorktree.mainPath = "/repo-a"` produces an active detection for change `"c-a"`
- **AND** the poll cache for the worktree cwd is initialized and does NOT list `"c-a"`
- **AND** the poll cache for `/repo-a` lists `"c-a"`
- **THEN** the change SHALL be treated as local
- **AND** the auto-attach branch logic SHALL proceed unchanged

#### Scenario: Manual attach is not subject to the gate

- **WHEN** a user manually attaches change `"c-b"` to a session whose candidate roots do not list `"c-b"`
- **THEN** the attachment SHALL be applied

#### Scenario: Unreported worktree state does not cause rejection

- **WHEN** a session's worktree state has never been reported by the bridge
- **AND** its `cwd` cache is initialized and does not list the detected change
- **THEN** the gate SHALL allow the attach
- **AND** no rejection notice SHALL be emitted

#### Scenario: Reported non-worktree session is still gated on its cwd

- **WHEN** the bridge has reported that a session is not a worktree
- **AND** its `cwd` cache is initialized and does not list the detected change
- **THEN** the gate SHALL reject

#### Scenario: Reporting a non-worktree session sets the indicator

- **WHEN** the bridge reports worktree state for a session that is not a worktree
- **THEN** the session's `gitWorktreeReported` indicator SHALL be set
- **AND** the session SHALL thereafter be reject-capable on its `cwd` alone

#### Scenario: Non-git session is reject-capable without any worktree report

- **WHEN** a session is known not to be a git repository
- **AND** no worktree report has ever been received for it
- **AND** its `cwd` cache is initialized and does not list the detected change
- **THEN** the gate SHALL reject

#### Scenario: Restored worktree path contributes a root before any report

- **WHEN** a session's worktree main path is present from restored session metadata
- **AND** the session is not yet worktree-resolved
- **THEN** the main path SHALL contribute a candidate root
- **AND** an unknown root SHALL also be contributed

#### Scenario: Indicator is not broadcast

- **WHEN** the server updates a session's worktree state
- **THEN** the update broadcast to clients SHALL NOT include the `gitWorktreeReported` indicator

### Requirement: Locality gate treats an unpopulated cache as unknown

The locality gate SHALL distinguish a positive absence from an unpopulated cache. A candidate root whose cached data is missing or whose `initialized` flag is false SHALL be treated as unknown, not as absent. The gate SHALL reject only when every candidate root reports an initialized cache and none lists the detected change; when any candidate root is unknown, the gate SHALL allow.

#### Scenario: Uninitialized cache allows the attach

- **WHEN** an active detection for change `"c-a"` occurs for a session whose only candidate root has no cached OpenSpec data
- **THEN** the gate SHALL allow the attach
- **AND** no rejection notice SHALL be emitted

#### Scenario: Mixed known-absent and unknown roots allows the attach

- **WHEN** a session's `cwd` cache is initialized and does not list `"c-a"`
- **AND** the session's `gitWorktree.mainPath` cache is uninitialized
- **THEN** the gate SHALL allow the attach

#### Scenario: All roots initialized and absent rejects

- **WHEN** every candidate root for a session reports an initialized cache
- **AND** none of them lists the detected change
- **THEN** the gate SHALL reject

### Requirement: Locality rejection surfaces a deduplicated notice

When the locality gate rejects a detected change, the server SHALL emit one notification through the existing per-session notify channel, at level `info`, naming the rejected change and indicating it lies outside the session's folder.

The server SHALL emit at most one such notification per distinct `(sessionId, changeName)` pair for the lifetime of the session in memory, so that a repeated tool call cannot exhaust the bounded notify log.

Beyond appending to the notification log itself, the notification SHALL NOT alter session state: it SHALL NOT set `currentTool`, SHALL NOT mark the session unread, SHALL NOT reorder the session, and SHALL NOT contribute to any pending-ask or pending-prompt derivation.

The server SHALL suppress the notification when the rejected change name has previously been detected in the same session on evidence that appeared local — that is, from a change-creating CLI invocation, or from a path contained by a candidate root. Suppression SHALL be keyed on the change name, not on the pattern that produced the current detection, so that a write to a just-created change's own files does not produce a misleading notification.

Deduplication state SHALL be recorded only when a notification is actually emitted. A suppressed rejection SHALL NOT record it, so that a later genuine rejection of the same change name is still reported.

Both per-session records used by this requirement — the emitted-notification set and the locally-evidenced change-name set — SHALL be cleared when the session unregisters, so that neither retains state for a session that no longer exists.

#### Scenario: First rejection notifies

- **WHEN** the locality gate rejects change `"c-b"` for a session for the first time
- **AND** the detection did not originate from a change-creating CLI pattern
- **THEN** the server SHALL append one notify entry naming `"c-b"` at level `info`

#### Scenario: Creation-type detection rejects without notifying

- **WHEN** the locality gate rejects a change detected from an `openspec new change` command
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT append a notify entry
- **AND** the rejection SHALL still take effect (no attach, no `openspecChange` stamp)

#### Scenario: Write to a just-created change does not notify

- **WHEN** a session creates change `"c-a"` via an `openspec new change` command that the gate rejects on a stale cache
- **AND** the session then writes to a path inside `"c-a"` that is contained by a candidate root
- **AND** the gate rejects that detection too
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT append a notify entry for either detection

#### Scenario: In-cwd path evidence alone suppresses the notice

- **WHEN** the locality gate rejects change `"c-a"` detected from a path contained by a candidate root
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT append a notify entry

#### Scenario: Suppressed rejection does not silence a later genuine notice

- **WHEN** a detection for change `"c-b"` is rejected and suppressed for lack of foreign evidence
- **AND** a later detection for `"c-b"` is rejected for the same session on evidence that did not appear local
- **THEN** the server SHALL append one notify entry naming `"c-b"`

#### Scenario: Repeated rejection of the same change does not re-notify

- **WHEN** the locality gate rejects change `"c-b"` for the same session a second time
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT append a further notify entry

#### Scenario: Locally-evidenced state is cleared when the session unregisters

- **WHEN** a session that recorded locally-evidenced change names unregisters
- **THEN** the retained locally-evidenced state for that session SHALL NOT persist

#### Scenario: Dedupe state is cleared when the session unregisters

- **WHEN** a session that previously suppressed a repeat notice for `"c-b"` unregisters
- **AND** a session with the same identifier later registers and the gate rejects `"c-b"` again
- **THEN** the server SHALL append a notify entry
- **AND** the retained dedupe state for the unregistered session SHALL NOT persist

#### Scenario: Rejection of a different change notifies separately

- **WHEN** the locality gate rejects change `"c-b"` and later change `"c-c"` for the same session
- **THEN** the server SHALL append exactly one notify entry per distinct change name

#### Scenario: Notice does not make the session appear busy

- **WHEN** a locality rejection notice is emitted for an idle session
- **THEN** the session SHALL NOT gain a pending ask, a pending prompt request, or a `currentTool` value

### Requirement: Activity detector is scoped to a session cwd

The activity detector SHALL accept the session's `cwd` as a required parameter and SHALL NOT report a change name that provably belongs to another root.

A path-derived match SHALL be reported only when the matched path, resolved against the session `cwd` when relative, is contained by the session `cwd` using directory-boundary-correct matching, such that a sibling path sharing a leading string prefix is not treated as contained.

A command-derived match SHALL NOT be reported when the command relocates the working directory to a path outside the session `cwd` **anywhere** in the command string, whether that relocation appears before or after the OpenSpec invocation. The predicate is deliberately position-insensitive and applies uniformly to every command pattern the detector recognises, so that no pattern is governed by a different rule.

Because `cwd` is a required parameter, every call site SHALL be updated; the detector SHALL NOT provide a permissive default.

#### Scenario: Absolute change path inside the session cwd is detected

- **WHEN** a tool call references `/repo-a/openspec/changes/c-a/tasks.md`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL report `changeName: "c-a"`

#### Scenario: Absolute change path in another root is not detected

- **WHEN** a tool call references `/repo-b/openspec/changes/c-b/tasks.md`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL NOT report a change name

#### Scenario: Sibling prefix path is not detected

- **WHEN** a tool call references `/repo-a-other/openspec/changes/c-b/tasks.md`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL NOT report a change name

#### Scenario: Relative change path is resolved against the session cwd

- **WHEN** a tool call references `openspec/changes/c-a/tasks.md`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL report `changeName: "c-a"`

#### Scenario: Outside relocation suppresses archive and flag patterns too

- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `cd /repo-b && openspec archive c-b`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL NOT report a change name

#### Scenario: Outside relocation after the invocation suppresses flag patterns too

- **WHEN** a bash tool call contains `openspec validate --change c-b && cd /repo-b`
- **AND** the session `cwd` is `/repo-a`
- **THEN** the detector SHALL NOT report a change name
