# provider-auth-server Specification

## Purpose
Server-side contract for managing pi LLM provider credentials: OAuth handler registry, `auth.json` CRUD with atomic write+lockfile, the bridge-pushed provider catalogue cache, and the `GET /api/provider-auth/status` API surface that drives the Settings → Provider Authentication UI.
## Requirements
### Requirement: OAuth provider registry

The server SHALL maintain a registry of OAuth provider handlers. Each handler SHALL expose its provider ID, display name, flow type (`auth_code` or `device_code`), and methods for its specific OAuth flow. The registry of available OAuth providers exposed by `GET /api/provider-auth/providers` SHALL be derived directly from the registered handler set, not from a separately maintained list. Each handler SHALL carry its own `displayName` field. The registry SHALL include handlers for: `anthropic`, `openai-codex`, `github-copilot`. Handlers for `google-gemini-cli` and `google-antigravity` are NOT included — pi 0.71 removed both as built-in providers and the dashboard's UI surfaces them via the catalogue rather than the handler registry.

#### Scenario: List available OAuth providers
- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /api/provider-auth/providers`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return a JSON array of objects, each containing `id`, `name`, and `flowType` for every registered OAuth handler, with `name` taken from the handler's `displayName` field

#### Scenario: Adding a new OAuth handler is the only required change
- **WHEN** a developer registers a new handler in the handler registry with `providerId`, `displayName`, and `flowType`
- **THEN** the new provider SHALL appear in the `GET /api/provider-auth/providers` response without any change to a separate provider list

#### Scenario: Removed pi providers do not appear
- **WHEN** the catalogue (`providers_list` from the bridge) reports the union of pi's known providers on pi 0.71+
- **THEN** `google-gemini-cli` and `google-antigravity` SHALL NOT appear in either the catalogue or the handler-id list

### Requirement: Auth-code OAuth flow — authorize
For auth-code providers (Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity), the server SHALL generate a PKCE code verifier and challenge, build the provider's authorization URL with the dashboard's callback redirect URI, and return the auth URL along with a flow ID. The server SHALL store the PKCE verifier and state server-side, keyed by flow ID.

#### Scenario: Start Anthropic OAuth
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/authorize` with `{ provider: "anthropic" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ flowId, authUrl }` where `authUrl` points to `claude.ai/oauth/authorize` with PKCE challenge, redirect URI, and scopes `org:create_api_key user:profile user:inference`

#### Scenario: Start OpenAI Codex OAuth
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/authorize` with `{ provider: "openai-codex" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ flowId, authUrl }` where `authUrl` points to `auth.openai.com/oauth/authorize` with PKCE challenge and scope `openid profile email offline_access`

#### Scenario: Start Gemini CLI OAuth
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/authorize` with `{ provider: "google-gemini-cli" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ flowId, authUrl }` where `authUrl` points to Google OAuth with scopes including `cloud-platform`, `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`, and `access_type=offline`

#### Scenario: Start Antigravity OAuth
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/authorize` with `{ provider: "google-antigravity" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ flowId, authUrl }` where `authUrl` points to Google OAuth with additional scopes `cclog` and `experimentsandconfigs`

### Requirement: Auth-code OAuth flow — exchange
The server SHALL accept an authorization code and flow ID, look up the stored PKCE verifier, exchange the code with the provider's token endpoint, perform any provider-specific post-exchange steps (e.g., project discovery for Google providers, accountId extraction for Codex), map the tokens to pi's `auth.json` format, and persist them.

#### Scenario: Exchange Anthropic code for tokens
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/exchange` with `{ flowId, code }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL POST to `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` with JSON body including `grant_type`, `client_id`, `code`, `redirect_uri`, `code_verifier`, and persist the resulting `{ type: "oauth", refresh, access, expires }` to `auth.json` under key `anthropic`

#### Scenario: Exchange Codex code with accountId extraction
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/exchange` with `{ flowId, code }` for `openai-codex`
- **THEN** the server SHALL exchange the code, decode the JWT access token to extract `accountId` from the `https://api.openai.com/auth` claim, and persist `{ type: "oauth", refresh, access, expires, accountId }` under key `openai-codex`

#### Scenario: Exchange Gemini CLI code with project discovery
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/exchange` with `{ flowId, code }` for `google-gemini-cli`
- **THEN** the server SHALL exchange the code using `client_id` and `client_secret`, call `loadCodeAssist` to discover/provision a Cloud project, and persist `{ type: "oauth", refresh, access, expires, projectId }` under key `google-gemini-cli`

#### Scenario: Exchange fails gracefully
- **WHEN** the provider's token endpoint returns an error
- **THEN** the server SHALL return HTTP 400 with `{ error: "..." }` describing the failure

#### Scenario: Unknown flow ID
- **WHEN** a client submits an exchange request with an invalid or expired `flowId`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return HTTP 400 with `{ error: "Invalid or expired flow" }`

### Requirement: Device-code OAuth flow
For device-code providers (GitHub Copilot), the server SHALL request a device code from the provider, return the verification URL and user code to the client, then poll the provider's token endpoint on a server-side interval until authorization completes or times out.

#### Scenario: Start GitHub Copilot device flow
- **WHEN** a client requests `POST /api/provider-auth/device-code` with `{ provider: "github-copilot" }` and optional `{ enterpriseDomain }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL request a device code from GitHub, return `{ flowId, userCode, verificationUri, expiresIn, interval }`, and begin polling in the background

#### Scenario: Poll completes successfully
- **WHEN** the user authorizes the device code on GitHub
- **THEN** the server SHALL obtain the GitHub access token, exchange it for a Copilot token via `copilot_internal/v2/token`, persist credentials to `auth.json` under key `github-copilot`, and make the result available when the client polls `GET /api/provider-auth/device-status/:flowId`

#### Scenario: Poll timeout
- **WHEN** the device code expires without authorization
- **THEN** the server SHALL stop polling and report `{ status: "expired" }` on the next client status check

### Requirement: OAuth callback route
The server SHALL serve a callback route at `GET /api/provider-auth/callback/:provider` that receives the OAuth redirect. This route SHALL return an HTML page that extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters and relays them to the opener window via `window.opener.postMessage()`, `BroadcastChannel("provider_oauth_callback")`, and `localStorage` as fallbacks.

#### Scenario: Successful callback relay
- **WHEN** the OAuth provider redirects to `/api/provider-auth/callback/anthropic?code=abc&state=xyz`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with an HTML page that sends `{ type: "provider_oauth_callback", data: { code: "abc", state: "xyz" } }` via postMessage to the opener and closes itself

#### Scenario: Error callback
- **WHEN** the OAuth provider redirects with `?error=access_denied`
- **THEN** the callback page SHALL relay the error to the opener via the same channels

### Requirement: API key provider registry
The server SHALL derive the list of API-key providers from the bridge-pushed provider catalogue (`providers_list` message), NOT from a hardcoded array. The most recently received catalogue is cached per pi process; on cache miss the server SHALL proactively send `request_providers` and use an empty list until the bridge responds. For every entry in the cached catalogue:

- If the catalogue id collides with a registered OAuth handler's `providerId`, the API-key row SHALL use the suffixed UI id `${id}-api`, the suffixed display name `${displayName} (API Key)`, and an `authJsonKey` equal to the unsuffixed catalogue id.
- If the catalogue id has no OAuth handler counterpart, the API-key row SHALL use the bare id and bare display name, with `authJsonKey` equal to the id.

The server SHALL pass the catalogue's `envVar` and `ambient` fields straight through to the corresponding `ProviderAuthStatus` rows. When `ambient: true`, the server SHALL force `authenticated: true` and `maskedKey: "(ambient)"` even when `auth.json` has no entry for `authJsonKey`.

#### Scenario: Catalogue from bridge defines the API-key list
- **WHEN** the bridge has pushed `providers_list` containing 25 entries (anthropic, deepseek, fireworks, ...)
- **AND** a client requests `GET /api/provider-auth/status`
- **THEN** the response SHALL include one row per entry, with `flowType: "api_key"` for non-OAuth ids and the `<id>-api` suffix for OAuth-collision ids

#### Scenario: OAuth/API-key collision uses suffixed id
- **WHEN** the catalogue contains an entry with `id: "anthropic"` and `hasOAuth: true`
- **AND** the OAuth handler set contains a handler with `providerId: "anthropic"`
- **THEN** the status response SHALL contain two distinct rows: one OAuth row with `id: "anthropic"`, `name: "Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max)"`, `flowType: "auth_code"` (from the handler), and one API-key row with `id: "anthropic-api"`, `name: "Anthropic (API Key)"`, `flowType: "api_key"`, `authJsonKey: "anthropic"`

#### Scenario: Provider with no OAuth uses bare id
- **WHEN** the catalogue contains an entry with `id: "deepseek"`, `hasOAuth: false`
- **THEN** the status response SHALL contain one row with `id: "deepseek"`, `flowType: "api_key"`, `authJsonKey: "deepseek"`

#### Scenario: Env-var hint surfaces from catalogue
- **WHEN** the catalogue's `openai` entry has `envVar: "OPENAI_API_KEY"`
- **THEN** the corresponding row in the status response SHALL include `envVar: "OPENAI_API_KEY"`

#### Scenario: Ambient credentials marked authenticated
- **WHEN** the catalogue's `google-vertex` entry has `ambient: true`
- **THEN** the row SHALL have `authenticated: true`, `ambient: true`, and `maskedKey: "(ambient)"` regardless of `auth.json` contents

#### Scenario: Catalogue not yet received
- **WHEN** the server has not yet received any `providers_list` from any bridge
- **THEN** the API-key portion of the status response SHALL be an empty array, the OAuth portion SHALL still be returned, and the server SHALL have proactively sent `request_providers` to all connected bridges

#### Scenario: Extension-registered provider appears
- **WHEN** another pi extension calls `pi.registerProvider("custom-llm", ...)` and the bridge pushes a fresh `providers_list`
- **THEN** the server cache SHALL be updated and a `custom-llm` row (or `custom-llm-api` if the OAuth handler set grows) SHALL appear in the next `GET /api/provider-auth/status` response without any server restart

### Requirement: API key masking format
When displaying a saved API key in the status response, the server SHALL mask the key by showing the first 5 characters, followed by `...`, followed by the last 3 characters. For keys shorter than 12 characters, the server SHALL return `****` instead.

#### Scenario: Mask a standard-length key
- **WHEN** a provider has a saved key `sk-abc123xyz789`
- **THEN** `maskedKey` SHALL be `sk-ab...789`

#### Scenario: Mask a short key
- **WHEN** a provider has a saved key `shortkey` (8 chars, under 12)
- **THEN** `maskedKey` SHALL be `****`

#### Scenario: Mask an empty key
- **WHEN** a provider has a saved key that is an empty string
- **THEN** the provider SHALL have `authenticated: false` and no `maskedKey`

### Requirement: Credential status API
The server SHALL expose `GET /api/provider-auth/status` returning the authentication status of all providers. For each provider it SHALL return: `id`, `name`, `flowType`, `authenticated` (boolean), and for OAuth providers the `expires` timestamp if authenticated. For API-key providers the response MAY include `envVar` (string, name of the env variable pi-ai consults for this provider) and `ambient` (boolean, true when the provider is configured via an ambient credential chain such as AWS profile or Google ADC). The server SHALL NOT return tokens or secrets.

The endpoint SHALL answer `200` with a JSON array whenever `auth.json`'s bytes are readable but are not a JSON plain object; corrupt credential content SHALL NOT produce a `5xx`. Every provider SHALL then be reported `authenticated: false`, which is truthful — no credential is readable.

#### Scenario: Mixed authenticated and unauthenticated providers
- **WHEN** `auth.json` contains credentials for `anthropic` and `openai` but not `github-copilot`
- **THEN** the status response SHALL show `authenticated: true` with `expires` for `anthropic`, `authenticated: true` for `openai` (API key, no expiry), and `authenticated: false` for `github-copilot`

#### Scenario: API-key row carries envVar hint
- **WHEN** the catalogue's `mistral` entry has `envVar: "MISTRAL_API_KEY"` and `auth.json` has no `mistral` entry
- **THEN** the `mistral` row in the status response SHALL include `envVar: "MISTRAL_API_KEY"` and `authenticated: false`

#### Scenario: Corrupt auth.json returns 200 with all providers unauthenticated
- **WHEN** `auth.json` is empty or truncated and a client requests `GET /api/provider-auth/status`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond `200` with a JSON array
- **AND** every row SHALL report `authenticated: false`

### Requirement: Credentials updated triggers per-session model refresh
When the server persists a credential change (`PUT /api/provider-auth/api-key`, `DELETE /api/provider-auth/:provider`, OAuth callback success, device-code completion, `PUT /api/providers`), it SHALL broadcast `credentials_updated` to every connected bridge so they reload `auth.json` + `~/.pi/agent/providers.json` and refresh their `ModelRegistry`. Each bridge SHALL then push a fresh per-session `models_list` (and `providers_list`) which the server forwards to browsers via the existing per-session broadcast.

The server SHALL NOT broadcast `models_refreshed` from any path. The previous design used a global broadcast that wiped every browser's `modelsMap` and re-requested only for the currently-selected session, which left previously-visited sessions in `subscribedRef` with empty dropdowns. The per-session `models_list` channel is self-healing without a wipe (see capability `model-refresh`).

The catalogue cache (`provider-catalogue-cache.ts`) is a pure read consumer for `GET /api/provider-auth/status`. Its update on `providers_list` arrival is idempotent and unobserved by browsers — the Settings UI re-fetches via the row-level `onChanged` callback after CRUD operations and via OAuth-flow polling during sign-in.

#### Scenario: Refresh after API-key write
- **WHEN** a client writes a new API key via `PUT /api/provider-auth/api-key`
- **THEN** the server SHALL persist the credential, broadcast `credentials_updated` to bridges, and return `{ ok: true }`
- **AND** each bridge SHALL push a fresh `models_list` for its own `sessionId` covering the new credential
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT broadcast `models_refreshed` to browsers

#### Scenario: Refresh after custom provider added
- **WHEN** a client writes a new custom provider via `PUT /api/providers`
- **THEN** the server SHALL persist the entry to `~/.pi/agent/providers.json`, broadcast `credentials_updated` to bridges, and return `{ success: true }`
- **AND** each bridge SHALL run `reloadProviders(pi)` (registering the new provider via `pi.registerProvider(...)` after async `discoverModels`)
- **AND** each bridge SHALL push fresh per-session `models_list` (and `providers_list`) reflecting the new provider's models
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT broadcast `models_refreshed` to browsers

#### Scenario: providers_list arrival does NOT broadcast
- **WHEN** the bridge for any session sends a `providers_list` (initial connect, fork, resume, reconnect, content change, or response to `request_providers`)
- **THEN** the server SHALL overwrite the cached catalogue snapshot via `setCatalogueForSession`
- **AND** the server SHALL NOT broadcast `models_refreshed` to browsers regardless of whether contents changed

#### Scenario: New session spawn does NOT wipe other sessions' models
- **WHEN** a new pi process spawns and its bridge sends its first `providers_list` and `models_list`
- **THEN** the server SHALL forward `models_list` per-session via `broadcastToAll`
- **AND** the server SHALL update the catalogue cache silently
- **AND** previously-visited sessions in browsers' `subscribedRef` SHALL retain their `modelsMap` entries unchanged

#### Scenario: Stale browser query before refresh completes
- **WHEN** a client polls `GET /api/provider-auth/status` immediately after a write, before the bridge round-trip completes
- **THEN** the response SHALL reflect the previous catalogue plus the just-written `auth.json` change (the server-side `auth.json` masked-key extraction is local and immediate; only the env/ambient fields lag the bridge round-trip)

### Requirement: API key CRUD
The server SHALL expose `PUT /api/provider-auth/api-key` accepting `{ provider, key }` to save an API key credential, and `DELETE /api/provider-auth/:provider` to remove any credential (OAuth or API key). Both SHALL write to `auth.json` atomically with file locking.

#### Scenario: Save API key
- **WHEN** a client sends `PUT /api/provider-auth/api-key` with `{ provider: "openai", key: "sk-..." }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL write `{ "openai": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-..." } }` to `auth.json` (merging with existing entries) and return `{ ok: true }`

#### Scenario: Remove credential
- **WHEN** a client sends `DELETE /api/provider-auth/anthropic`
- **THEN** the server SHALL remove the `anthropic` key from `auth.json` and return `{ ok: true }`

### Requirement: auth.json atomic write with locking
All writes to `auth.json` SHALL use a lockfile (`auth.json.lock`) with retry logic. If the file does not exist, it SHALL be created with `0600` permissions. Existing owner permission bits SHALL be preserved on update, with group/world bits always cleared (normalized to owner-only), so a legacy wider mode cannot persist. The staged `auth.json.tmp` SHALL have its mode explicitly enforced before the rename, because `writeFileSync`'s `mode` argument applies only at file creation. See change: fix-corrupt-auth-json-500.

The lock helper's own placeholder create — the empty `{}` file written so the lockfile has a target to lock — SHALL also use mode `0600`. Writing it without an explicit mode yields `0666 & ~umask` (typically `0644`), which `writeAuthJson`'s permission-preservation then carries forward to every subsequent write, leaving the credential file group- and world-readable.

#### Scenario: Concurrent write protection
- **WHEN** two write operations occur simultaneously
- **THEN** one SHALL acquire the lock and complete; the other SHALL retry after a delay and then complete without data loss

#### Scenario: New file creation
- **WHEN** `auth.json` does not exist and a credential is saved
- **THEN** the file SHALL be created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only)

#### Scenario: Lock placeholder create is 0600
- **WHEN** `auth.json` does not exist and any locked operation runs, causing the lock helper to pre-create the file
- **THEN** the pre-created file SHALL have mode `0600`
- **AND** the credential file written afterwards SHALL retain mode `0600`

### Requirement: Bridge notification on credential change
After any credential write (OAuth save, API key save, or credential removal), the server SHALL broadcast a `credentials_updated` message to all connected pi sessions via the pi WebSocket gateway.

#### Scenario: OAuth login triggers bridge notification
- **WHEN** a user completes OAuth login for Anthropic
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ type: "credentials_updated" }` to all connected bridge extensions via the pi gateway

### Requirement: Server exposes registered handler ids

The server SHALL expose `GET /api/provider-auth/handlers` returning `{ ids: string[] }` — the list of provider ids the dashboard's hand-written handler registry can drive. Distinct from the catalogue (which is the union of pi's providers): a catalogue id without a matching handler id is an OAuth provider the UI knows about but the dashboard cannot complete a login flow for. The UI SHALL render disabled-with-tooltip rows for those gaps.

#### Scenario: Default handler ids
- **WHEN** the server starts with the default handler registry
- **THEN** `GET /api/provider-auth/handlers` returns `{ ids: ["anthropic", "openai-codex", "github-copilot"] }`

#### Scenario: Catalogue lists provider not in handlers
- **WHEN** the bridge has pushed a catalogue containing `{ id: "custom-llm", hasOAuth: true }` (e.g. from `pi.registerProvider({ oauth: ... })`)
- **AND** `GET /api/provider-auth/handlers` returns ids without `custom-llm`
- **THEN** `GET /api/provider-auth/status` SHALL still emit the `custom-llm` OAuth row (UI gates rendering on the handler-id set)
- **AND** `POST /api/provider-auth/authorize` for `custom-llm` SHALL return 400 with `error: "Unknown auth-code provider: custom-llm"` (existing behavior preserved)

### Requirement: auth.json corrupt-content recovery
Reading `auth.json` SHALL NOT fail because of its *content*. When the file's bytes are readable but do not parse as a JSON **plain object** — empty file, truncated JSON, `null`, an array, or a scalar — the server SHALL treat the credential set as empty (`{}`) and SHALL quarantine the bad bytes.

A leading UTF-8 BOM SHALL be stripped before parsing, so a BOM-prefixed but otherwise valid file is NOT classified as corrupt.

Quarantine SHALL copy the bad bytes to `auth.json.corrupt-<stamp>` in the same directory and SHALL NOT rename, move, truncate, or delete `auth.json`. `<stamp>` SHALL be `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSsssZ` with no `:` character, so the name is valid on NTFS. The copy SHALL be created with the exclusive `wx` flag and mode `0600`; on `EEXIST` a numeric `-1`, `-2`, … suffix SHALL be appended so an existing backup is never overwritten.

The server SHALL log one line naming the quarantine path and the reason. The log line, the backup filename, and any HTTP error body SHALL NOT contain credential material.

Failures to *read the bytes at all* (`EACCES`, `EISDIR`, `EMFILE`, Windows `EPERM`/`EBUSY`) are NOT corrupt-content conditions and SHALL still throw. `ENOENT` SHALL keep its existing meaning: `{}`, no quarantine, no log.

#### Scenario: Empty auth.json yields an empty credential set
- **WHEN** `auth.json` exists and is zero bytes
- **THEN** the read SHALL return `{}` without throwing
- **AND** a copy of the file SHALL be written to `auth.json.corrupt-<stamp>` with mode `0600`
- **AND** `auth.json` SHALL still exist with its original bytes

#### Scenario: Truncated JSON is quarantined
- **WHEN** `auth.json` contains `{"anthropic": {"type": "oauth", "refr`
- **THEN** the read SHALL return `{}` without throwing
- **AND** the quarantine copy SHALL contain those exact bytes

#### Scenario: Valid JSON that is not a plain object is corrupt
- **WHEN** `auth.json` contains `null`, `[]`, or `42`
- **THEN** the read SHALL return `{}` without throwing and SHALL quarantine the bytes

#### Scenario: BOM-prefixed valid JSON is not corrupt
- **WHEN** `auth.json` contains a UTF-8 BOM followed by `{"openai":{"type":"api_key","key":"sk-x"}}`
- **THEN** the read SHALL return the `openai` credential
- **AND** no quarantine file SHALL be created

#### Scenario: Quarantine filename contains no colon
- **WHEN** any quarantine occurs
- **THEN** the created filename SHALL match `auth.json.corrupt-<stamp>` where `<stamp>` contains no `:` character

#### Scenario: Existing backup is never overwritten
- **WHEN** a quarantine target name already exists on disk
- **THEN** the server SHALL create `auth.json.corrupt-<stamp>-1` (then `-2`, …) instead of overwriting it

#### Scenario: Unreadable file still throws
- **WHEN** `readFileSync` on `auth.json` fails with `EACCES`
- **THEN** the read SHALL throw and SHALL NOT create a quarantine file

#### Scenario: Missing file is not a corruption
- **WHEN** `auth.json` does not exist
- **THEN** the read SHALL return `{}`, SHALL NOT create a quarantine file, and SHALL NOT log a quarantine line

#### Scenario: Quarantine is deduplicated by content
- **WHEN** the same corrupt bytes are read repeatedly within one process
- **THEN** exactly one quarantine copy SHALL be created for those bytes
- **AND** dedup identity SHALL be a hash of the bytes, not the file's size and mtime

#### Scenario: A failed quarantine copy is retried, not latched
- **WHEN** a quarantine copy fails and the same corrupt bytes are read again
- **THEN** the server SHALL attempt the copy again

#### Scenario: Read path swallows a quarantine failure
- **WHEN** the bytes are corrupt and the quarantine copy cannot be written
- **THEN** the read SHALL still return `{}` without throwing

### Requirement: Credential writes refuse to clobber un-backed-up bytes
A credential write (`writeCredential`, `removeCredential`) SHALL re-read `auth.json` while holding the lock, using a checked read that reports whether the content was corrupt and whether a recoverable copy exists on disk.

When the content is corrupt AND no recoverable copy exists, the write SHALL throw and SHALL persist nothing — the only path that can destroy the bytes is the only path allowed to fail. When the content is corrupt AND a recoverable copy exists, the write SHALL proceed against an empty credential set.

A quarantine **dedup hit** SHALL count as a recoverable copy existing: the flag means "a backup of these exact bytes is on disk", NOT "this call performed the copy". Otherwise the repair flow deadlocks — the mount-time read quarantines the bytes, and every later write, re-reading the still-corrupt file, would refuse forever.

#### Scenario: Write refuses when the backup could not be made
- **WHEN** `auth.json` is corrupt and the quarantine copy fails
- **AND** a client saves an API key
- **THEN** the write SHALL throw, `auth.json` SHALL be byte-identical to before, and no credential SHALL be persisted

#### Scenario: Write proceeds when the backup exists
- **WHEN** `auth.json` is corrupt and a quarantine copy was written successfully
- **AND** a client saves an API key for `openai`
- **THEN** `auth.json` SHALL be replaced with a file containing only the `openai` credential
- **AND** the pre-corruption bytes SHALL remain readable in the quarantine file

#### Scenario: Repair flow is not deadlocked by a dedup hit
- **GIVEN** a prior read already quarantined the corrupt bytes and recorded them as backed up
- **WHEN** a client saves an API key and the write re-reads the same still-corrupt `auth.json`
- **THEN** the write SHALL proceed (the dedup hit counts as backed up) and SHALL NOT throw

#### Scenario: Quarantine happens under the lock on the write path
- **WHEN** a write encounters corrupt content that no prior read had quarantined
- **THEN** the quarantine copy SHALL be attempted while the write lock is held, before any replacement of `auth.json`

### Requirement: Credential removal reports a refusal to the client
`DELETE /api/provider-auth/:provider` SHALL map a write refusal to a JSON body carrying an `error` string describing the reason, matching the shape `PUT /api/provider-auth/api-key` already returns, so the Settings UI can display why the operation failed instead of a generic fallback.

#### Scenario: Refused delete surfaces a reason
- **WHEN** a client sends `DELETE /api/provider-auth/anthropic` and the write refuses because the bytes could not be backed up
- **THEN** the response body SHALL include an `error` string naming the reason
- **AND** the body SHALL NOT contain credential material
