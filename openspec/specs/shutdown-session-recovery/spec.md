# shutdown-session-recovery Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change reopen-sessions-after-shutdown. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Server SHALL stamp a durable liveness marker on running sessions

While a session is running, the server SHALL eagerly persist a liveness marker `{ live: true, liveEpoch: <server boot id> }` into that session's `.meta.json` sidecar. The write SHALL be immediate (atomic tmp+rename), NOT deferred through the debounced field-write path, so the marker survives an unclean host shutdown.

#### Scenario: Live marker stamped on session activation

- **GIVEN** a pi session transitions to running (first turn boundary after spawn or resume)
- **WHEN** the server records its activity
- **THEN** the session's `.meta.json` SHALL contain `live: true`
- **AND** SHALL contain `liveEpoch` equal to the current server boot id
- **AND** the write SHALL be performed immediately, not via the debounced write queue

#### Scenario: Live marker not rewritten every event

- **GIVEN** a session already carries `live: true` with the current `liveEpoch`
- **WHEN** subsequent turn events arrive for the same session
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT issue a new eager liveness write for an unchanged marker

### Requirement: Intentional close SHALL clear the liveness marker with a reason

When a session is closed intentionally — manual close (`handleShutdown`), force-kill (`handleForceKill`), a clean server `stop()` tearing the session down, or ANY session unregister (explicit `session_unregister`, heartbeat expiry, run termination) — the server SHALL persist `{ live: false }` to the session's `.meta.json`. The unregister-path write SHALL be eager (atomic, not debounced): `unregister()` persists `status: "ended"` through the 1s-debounced save, and without an eager `live: false` a host death inside that window leaves `live: true` + a non-`ended` status on disk — the next cold start would offer (or in `auto` mode, silently respawn) a session that ended cleanly. Manual close and force-kill SHALL additionally persist `closedReason: "manual"`.

#### Scenario: Explicit unregister eagerly clears liveness

- **GIVEN** a running session with `live: true`
- **WHEN** the session unregisters cleanly (pi TUI quit sending `session_unregister`)
- **THEN** the session's `.meta.json` SHALL be updated to `live: false` immediately, without waiting for the debounced stats write
- **AND** SHALL NOT set `closedReason: "manual"`

#### Scenario: Manual close stamps closedReason

- **GIVEN** a running session with `live: true`
- **WHEN** the user closes it (a `shutdown` / `force_kill` message handled by the server)
- **THEN** the session's `.meta.json` SHALL be updated to `live: false`
- **AND** SHALL contain `closedReason: "manual"`

#### Scenario: Clean server stop clears liveness without manual reason

- **GIVEN** running sessions with `live: true`
- **WHEN** the server performs a clean `stop()` (idle timer or app quit)
- **THEN** each torn-down session's `.meta.json` SHALL be updated to `live: false`
- **AND** SHALL NOT set `closedReason: "manual"`

### Requirement: Cold start SHALL classify interrupted sessions as recovery candidates

On server cold start, for each rediscovered session, the server SHALL classify it as a recovery candidate WHEN its `.meta.json` carries `live: true` AND its persisted `status` is NOT `"ended"` AND it does NOT carry `closedReason: "manual"` AND it is NOT an automation run session (`kind: "automation"`). All other sessions SHALL NOT be candidates.

Automation run sessions are fully exempt: respawning a headless rpc run detached from its automation (no per-fire context, no run finalization) would recreate the zombie-session class that `fix-automation-stop-zombie-runs` terminates. They normalize to `ended` like any non-candidate.

Both durable signals are required because neither alone is sufficient. A clean close runs `unregister()`, which sets and persists `status: "ended"` — this covers BOTH a dashboard close and a pi TUI quit, so the `status !== "ended"` condition excludes every clean unregister. A crash never reaches `unregister()`, so the sidecar keeps its last running status. A clean server `stop()` (idle timer / app quit) clears `live: false` WITHOUT unregistering each session, leaving a non-`ended` status; the `live === true` condition excludes that case. Together they match EXACTLY the crash scenario.

#### Scenario: Automation run session is never a candidate

- **GIVEN** a session whose `.meta.json` carries `live: true`, a non-`ended` status, and `kind: "automation"`
- **WHEN** the server cold-starts
- **THEN** the session SHALL NOT be a recovery candidate
- **AND** its status SHALL be normalized to `ended` like any non-candidate

#### Scenario: Interrupted (crashed) session is a candidate

- **GIVEN** a `.meta.json` with `live: true` and a non-`ended` status (e.g. `idle`/`streaming`) and no `closedReason`
- **WHEN** the server classifies sessions on cold start
- **THEN** the session SHALL be a recovery candidate

#### Scenario: Cleanly stopped session is not a candidate

- **GIVEN** a `.meta.json` with `live: false` (idle timer / app-quit clean stop), regardless of status
- **WHEN** the server classifies sessions on cold start
- **THEN** the session SHALL NOT be a recovery candidate

#### Scenario: Cleanly unregistered session (dashboard close or pi TUI quit) is not a candidate

- **GIVEN** a `.meta.json` whose persisted `status` is `"ended"` (a clean `unregister()` ran), even if `live: true` remains set
- **WHEN** the server classifies sessions on cold start
- **THEN** the session SHALL NOT be a recovery candidate

#### Scenario: Manual close is not a candidate

- **GIVEN** a `.meta.json` carrying `closedReason: "manual"`
- **WHEN** the server classifies sessions on cold start
- **THEN** the session SHALL NOT be a recovery candidate

#### Scenario: Pre-feature session without marker is not a candidate

- **GIVEN** a `.meta.json` that contains no `live` field
- **WHEN** the server classifies sessions on cold start
- **THEN** the session SHALL NOT be a recovery candidate

### Requirement: Recovery candidates SHALL be exempt from cold-start status normalization

The existing cold-start restore logic that force-rewrites any non-`ended` session status to `ended` SHALL NOT apply to recovery candidates. Non-candidate sessions SHALL retain the existing normalization behavior unchanged.

#### Scenario: Candidate status preserved through restore

- **GIVEN** a recovery candidate restored on cold start
- **WHEN** the restore status-normalization step runs
- **THEN** the candidate's status SHALL NOT be force-rewritten to `ended`

#### Scenario: Non-candidate normalization unchanged

- **GIVEN** a restored session that is NOT a recovery candidate and has a non-`ended` status
- **WHEN** the restore status-normalization step runs
- **THEN** its status SHALL be rewritten to `ended` exactly as today

### Requirement: Server SHALL offer to reopen recovery candidates gated by a setting

On cold start with at least one recovery candidate, the server's behavior SHALL be governed by the `reopenSessionsAfterShutdown` setting: `off` (do NOT classify interrupted sessions as candidates — normalize them to `ended` like any other non-`ended` restored session, so none remain in a non-`ended` "zombie" state), `ask` (broadcast a single recovery offer to all connected clients), or `auto` (resume all candidates without prompting). The default SHALL be `ask`.

#### Scenario: Ask mode broadcasts one offer

- **GIVEN** setting `reopenSessionsAfterShutdown = "ask"` and N ≥ 1 candidates
- **WHEN** the server completes cold-start classification
- **THEN** it SHALL broadcast exactly one recovery offer listing the N candidates to all connected clients

#### Scenario: Off mode takes no action and normalizes interrupted sessions

- **GIVEN** setting `reopenSessionsAfterShutdown = "off"`
- **AND** a session that would otherwise classify as an interrupted recovery candidate
- **WHEN** cold start runs
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT broadcast a recovery offer and SHALL NOT auto-resume
- **AND** the session's non-`ended` status SHALL be force-normalized to `ended` (no persistent zombie state)

#### Scenario: Auto mode resumes without prompting

- **GIVEN** setting `reopenSessionsAfterShutdown = "auto"` and N ≥ 1 candidates
- **WHEN** the server completes cold-start classification
- **THEN** it SHALL resume each candidate via the existing resume flow
- **AND** SHALL NOT broadcast a recovery prompt

#### Scenario: No candidates yields no offer

- **GIVEN** zero recovery candidates on cold start
- **WHEN** classification completes (in any setting mode)
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT broadcast a recovery offer

### Requirement: Ask-mode prompt SHALL surface as a sticky top-right notification

In `ask` mode the client SHALL render the recovery offer as a notification in the existing top-right notification stack (shared with dashboard toasts), NOT as a blocking modal or a full-width banner. The notification SHALL be sticky — it SHALL NOT auto-dismiss on a timer the way ordinary toasts do. It SHALL offer a single primary action to reopen the candidates and a non-destructive dismiss. Dismissing SHALL NOT delete or alter the sessions on disk.

#### Scenario: Offer renders in the top-right notification stack

- **GIVEN** an `ask`-mode recovery offer is received by a client
- **WHEN** the client renders it
- **THEN** it SHALL appear in the top-right notification stack alongside any other notifications
- **AND** SHALL NOT block interaction with the dashboard beneath it

#### Scenario: Offer does not auto-time-out

- **GIVEN** a rendered recovery offer notification
- **WHEN** time passes with no user action
- **THEN** the notification SHALL remain visible (no auto-dismiss timer)

#### Scenario: Resuming any session clears the offer

- **GIVEN** a rendered recovery offer notification that the user has not acted on
- **WHEN** the user opens or resumes any session
- **THEN** the client SHALL dismiss the recovery offer notification

#### Scenario: Offer shown once per dirty boot

- **GIVEN** a recovery offer was dismissed (explicitly or by resuming a session)
- **WHEN** no new unclean shutdown has occurred since
- **THEN** the client SHALL NOT re-show the offer

### Requirement: Reopen SHALL reuse the existing resume flow and dedupe across devices

Reopening a recovery candidate SHALL use the existing `resume_session` flow. Concurrent reopen requests for the same session from multiple connected devices SHALL be deduplicated by the existing `pendingResumeIntents` registry such that the session is spawned at most once.

#### Scenario: Two devices reopen the same candidate

- **GIVEN** two clients each accept the reopen offer for the same candidate session
- **WHEN** both `resume_session` requests reach the server
- **THEN** `pendingResumeIntents` SHALL deduplicate them
- **AND** the underlying session SHALL be resumed at most once

### Requirement: Recovery SHALL NOT depend on the home-lock

The recovery-candidate classification SHALL be derived solely from per-session `.meta.json` liveness markers and SHALL NOT read the home-lock file or its metadata sidecar to infer whether the previous run ended cleanly.

#### Scenario: Classification ignores lock state

- **GIVEN** a cold start with any home-lock state (present, absent, stale, or freshly released)
- **WHEN** the server classifies recovery candidates
- **THEN** the classification result SHALL depend only on per-session `.meta.json` fields (`live`, `status`, `closedReason`)
- **AND** SHALL NOT change based on the home-lock file or its metadata

### Requirement: Recovery offer SHALL render with defined theme tokens so its surface and primary action are visible

The recovery offer notification SHALL bind its card background and its primary
"Reopen" action background to CSS custom properties that are declared in the active
theme. It SHALL NOT reference undeclared custom properties for these paints, because
an undeclared custom property resolves to the empty string and yields an unset
background — a transparent card or an invisible action. Specifically, the card
background SHALL use `--bg-surface` and the primary action background SHALL use
`--accent-primary` (both declared for every theme in `packages/client/src/index.css`).

#### Scenario: Offer card paints an opaque elevated surface

- **GIVEN** the recovery offer notification is rendered in any theme
- **WHEN** the client paints the offer card
- **THEN** the card background SHALL resolve to a defined theme token (`--bg-surface`)
- **AND** the card SHALL NOT be transparent

#### Scenario: Reopen action is visible

- **GIVEN** a rendered recovery offer notification
- **WHEN** the client paints the primary "Reopen" action
- **THEN** the action background SHALL resolve to a defined theme token (`--accent-primary`)
- **AND** the action SHALL be visible and clickable

#### Scenario: No undeclared custom properties on the offer

- **GIVEN** the recovery offer component source
- **WHEN** its style bindings are inspected
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT reference `--bg-elevated` or `--accent`
- **AND** every custom property it references for a background SHALL be declared in the theme
