# worktree-spawn-dialog Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change auto-fill-branch-from-proposal-in-worktree-dialog. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: `attachProposal` prop drives branch input reactively

The `WorktreeSpawnDialog` accepts an optional `attachProposal?: string` prop. The dialog SHALL react to changes of this prop at runtime (not only at mount) by updating the branch input, subject to a dirty-flag guard:

- The dialog SHALL track a `branchDirty` flag, initialized `false`. The flag SHALL flip to `true` on the first user `onChange` of the branch input. The mount-time value (from `initialBranch`) SHALL NOT flip the flag.
- When `attachProposal` changes to a non-empty string AND `branchDirty` is `false`, the dialog SHALL set the branch input to `"os/" + attachProposal`.
- When `attachProposal` changes to `undefined`/empty AND `branchDirty` is `false`, the dialog SHALL revert the branch input to `initialBranch ?? ""`.
- When `branchDirty` is `true`, the dialog SHALL NOT modify the branch input in response to `attachProposal` changes.

The path preview (`derivedPath`) SHALL update automatically through the existing `slug → derivedPath` `useMemo` chain — no separate effect required.

#### Scenario: Mount with attachProposal preloads branch
- **WHEN** the dialog mounts with `attachProposal="add-foo"` and no `initialBranch`
- **THEN** the branch input SHALL render `os/add-foo` on first paint
- **THEN** the path preview SHALL render `<repo>/.worktrees/add-foo`

#### Scenario: attachProposal arrives after mount and branch is pristine
- **WHEN** the dialog is mounted with no `attachProposal` AND the user has not typed in the branch input AND the parent re-renders with `attachProposal="add-foo"`
- **THEN** the branch input SHALL update to `os/add-foo`

#### Scenario: User-typed branch wins over later attachProposal change
- **WHEN** the dialog is mounted with no `attachProposal` AND the user types `feature/x` into the branch input AND the parent re-renders with `attachProposal="add-foo"`
- **THEN** the branch input SHALL remain `feature/x`

#### Scenario: attachProposal cleared while branch pristine reverts
- **WHEN** the dialog was rendered with `attachProposal="add-foo"` AND the user did NOT type in the branch input AND the parent re-renders with `attachProposal=undefined`
- **THEN** the branch input SHALL revert to `initialBranch ?? ""` (empty when no `initialBranch`)

#### Scenario: attachProposal swap while branch dirty is ignored
- **WHEN** the dialog was rendered with `attachProposal="add-foo"` AND the user typed `os/other` into the branch input AND the parent re-renders with `attachProposal="add-bar"`
- **THEN** the branch input SHALL remain `os/other`

#### Scenario: Backward-compat — initialBranch alone unchanged
- **WHEN** the dialog mounts with `initialBranch="os/preset"` and no `attachProposal`
- **THEN** the branch input SHALL render `os/preset` on first paint (preserving the existing per-change `⑂+` flow)

### Requirement: Base-branch field is a filterable typeahead combobox

The "Base branch" field in `WorktreeSpawnDialog` SHALL be rendered as a typeahead combobox (not a native HTML `<select>`). The combobox SHALL be collapsed by default, expand to a popover on user interaction, and allow the user to filter the available branches by typing.

The set of selectable branches SHALL be the union of local and remote branches returned by `GET /api/git/branches?cwd=…` for the dialog's `cwd`. The user SHALL NOT be able to commit a free-text value that does not match an existing branch: the base branch must already exist in the repository.

The component SHALL implement the WAI-ARIA combobox pattern: the trigger SHALL carry `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-haspopup="listbox"`; the popover listbox SHALL carry `role="listbox"` and each option `role="option"` with `aria-selected` reflecting the committed selection (the row whose branch name equals the chosen `base`), per the WAI-ARIA single-select listbox contract. The keyboard highlight is a visual-only cursor and SHALL NOT drive `aria-selected`.

#### Scenario: Collapsed by default

- **WHEN** the dialog mounts and finishes loading branches
- **THEN** the base-branch field SHALL render a single collapsed trigger button showing the currently selected base
- **AND** no listbox or filter input SHALL be present in the DOM

#### Scenario: Opening the combobox

- **WHEN** the user clicks the base-branch trigger
- **THEN** a popover SHALL open below the trigger containing a filter input and a listbox of branches
- **AND** the filter input SHALL receive focus
- **AND** `aria-expanded` on the trigger SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: Typeahead filtering

- **WHEN** the popover is open AND the user types text into the filter input
- **THEN** the listbox SHALL display only branches whose name contains the typed text (case-insensitive substring match)
- **AND** branches not matching SHALL be removed from the rendered listbox

#### Scenario: Keyboard selection

- **WHEN** the popover is open
- **THEN** ArrowDown / ArrowUp SHALL move the highlight through the filtered branches (with wraparound)
- **AND** Enter on a highlighted branch SHALL set `base` to that branch's name AND close the popover
- **AND** Escape SHALL close the popover without changing `base` AND SHALL NOT propagate to the parent dialog (the dialog SHALL remain open)

#### Scenario: Mouse selection

- **WHEN** the popover is open AND the user clicks a branch row
- **THEN** `base` SHALL be set to that branch's name AND the popover SHALL close

#### Scenario: Outside-click closes popover

- **WHEN** the popover is open AND the user clicks outside the combobox (but still inside the dialog)
- **THEN** the popover SHALL close without changing `base`
- **AND** the dialog SHALL remain open

#### Scenario: No-match Enter is a no-op

- **WHEN** the popover is open AND the filter text matches zero branches AND the user presses Enter
- **THEN** `base` SHALL NOT change
- **AND** the popover SHALL remain open
- **AND** no synthetic branch SHALL be created from the filter text

#### Scenario: Local and remote sections

- **WHEN** the listbox is displayed and both local and remote branches are present
- **THEN** local branches SHALL appear first followed by a visual separator labelled "Remote" and then remote branches
- **AND** when only one of local or remote is present, no separator SHALL render

#### Scenario: Current-branch marker

- **WHEN** the listbox displays branches AND one of them is the repository's current branch
- **THEN** that branch SHALL be marked with a `●` indicator
- **AND** the current branch SHALL remain selectable as a base (in contrast to `BranchPicker`'s checkout flow, where current is non-selectable)

#### Scenario: No usable default base

- **WHEN** the dialog computes `hasUsableBase === false` (no current branch and no fallback)
- **THEN** the trigger SHALL render the placeholder text `"no usable default base — pick one"`
- **AND** the submit button SHALL remain disabled until the user selects a base

#### Scenario: Public dialog contract unchanged

- **WHEN** the user selects a base via the combobox and submits
- **THEN** the resulting `onSpawn` payload SHALL carry the same `base` field shape as before this change
- **AND** the dialog's other props (`cwd`, `onCancel`, `initialBranch`, `attachProposal`) SHALL behave identically to before

### Requirement: From-a-pull-request creation mode

The "Create a new worktree" section of `WorktreeSpawnDialog` SHALL offer a **ternary** source toggle with three modes: **Fork to new branch**, **Check out existing branch**, and **From a pull request**. Each mode reveals its own field set; switching modes preserves picker selections where the underlying ref shape is compatible.

The three modes SHALL behave as follows:

1. **Fork to new branch** (`mode === "fork"`) — the existing fork form. Picker selects a base ref; the user types a new branch name; submit calls `createWorktree({cwd, base, newBranch, path?})`. Path is derived from `slugifyBranch(newBranch)`.

2. **Check out existing branch** (`mode === "checkout"`) — picker selects a branch ref directly; no new-branch input is rendered; submit calls `createWorktree({cwd, base, path?})` with `newBranch` omitted (the server runs `git worktree add <path> <base>` without `-b`). Path is derived from `slugifyBranch(localNameOf(base))` where `localNameOf("origin/foo") === "foo"`. The picker label SHALL read **Branch** (not **Base branch**) in this mode. `canSubmit` SHALL require only `base.trim().length > 0`.

3. **From a pull request** (`mode === "from-pr"`) — the PR-change form. `PrCombobox` selects an open PR; submit calls `POST /api/git/worktree/from-pr` with `{cwd, prNumber, path}`. Lazy-load and gh-unavailable behaviour is unchanged from the original PR-change requirement.

The new-branch input (`data-testid="worktree-new-branch-input"`) SHALL be present in the DOM only when `mode === "fork"`. The `PrCombobox` SHALL be present only when `mode === "from-pr"`.

When the server returns `branch_in_use` for a `"checkout"`-mode submit, the dialog SHALL render the full server `message` (which includes the path of the worktree currently holding the branch) inline below the picker.

#### Scenario: Three-way toggle renders in create section

- **WHEN** the dialog opens and finishes loading branches
- **THEN** a radio group with three options "Fork to new branch", "Check out existing branch", and "From a pull request" SHALL be visible inside the "Create a new worktree" section

#### Scenario: Fork mode field set

- **WHEN** `mode === "fork"`
- **THEN** the base-branch combobox, the new-branch input, and the derived-path preview SHALL render
- **AND** the new-branch input (`data-testid="worktree-new-branch-input"`) SHALL be present in the DOM
- **AND** submit SHALL call `POST /api/git/worktree` with `{cwd, base, newBranch, path?}`

#### Scenario: Checkout mode field set

- **WHEN** `mode === "checkout"`
- **THEN** the picker SHALL render with the label "Branch"
- **AND** the new-branch input SHALL NOT be present in the DOM
- **AND** the path preview SHALL render `<repo>/.worktrees/<slug(localNameOf(base))>`
- **AND** submit SHALL call `POST /api/git/worktree` with `{cwd, base, path?}` and no `newBranch` field

#### Scenario: Checkout mode renders branch_in_use with holding-worktree path

- **WHEN** `mode === "checkout"` AND the server returns `{success: false, error: "branch_in_use", message: "...at '/repo/.worktrees/bar'..."}`
- **THEN** the dialog SHALL render the full server `message` (including the path `/repo/.worktrees/bar`) inline below the picker

#### Scenario: PR mode unchanged

- **WHEN** `mode === "from-pr"`
- **THEN** the `PrCombobox`, gh-unavailable degradation, lazy-load on first activation, and `POST /api/git/worktree/from-pr` submit path SHALL behave exactly as specified by the `add-worktree-from-pull-request` change before this widening
- **AND** the binary-toggle scenarios from that change SHALL continue to hold with the option key renamed (`"from-branch"` → `"fork"`)

#### Scenario: Mode flip preserves compatible selections

- **WHEN** the user picks `base = "main"` in `"checkout"` mode AND flips to `"fork"` mode
- **THEN** the base-branch combobox SHALL retain `"main"` as the selected base
- **AND** the new-branch input SHALL render empty (or with the `attachProposal`-derived value if applicable)

### Requirement: Default mode derived from attachProposal

When `WorktreeSpawnDialog` mounts, it SHALL pick the initial `mode` based on the `attachProposal` prop, refining the original default introduced by `add-worktree-from-pull-request`:

- `attachProposal` is a non-empty string → initial `mode === "fork"`.
- `attachProposal` is `undefined` or empty → initial `mode === "checkout"`.
- `mode === "from-pr"` SHALL never be the auto-picked default (preserving the lazy-load contract from `add-worktree-from-pull-request`).

Subsequent runtime changes to `attachProposal` SHALL NOT flip the mode automatically; the user remains in control after first paint via the radio toggle.

#### Scenario: Plain +Worktree defaults to checkout

- **WHEN** the dialog mounts with `attachProposal` undefined
- **THEN** the mode selector SHALL show "Check out existing branch" as selected on first paint
- **AND** the new-branch input SHALL NOT be present in the DOM
- **AND** no PR list fetch SHALL be issued

#### Scenario: Proposal-driven +Worktree defaults to fork

- **WHEN** the dialog mounts with `attachProposal = "add-foo"`
- **THEN** the mode selector SHALL show "Fork to new branch" as selected on first paint
- **AND** the new-branch input SHALL be present with value `os/add-foo` (existing `attachProposal` behaviour from `auto-fill-branch-from-proposal-in-worktree-dialog`)

#### Scenario: User can flip mode after auto-pick

- **WHEN** the dialog mounted in `"checkout"` mode AND the user clicks the "Fork to new branch" radio
- **THEN** `mode` SHALL become `"fork"` AND the new-branch input SHALL appear
- **AND** the `base` selection SHALL be preserved across the flip

#### Scenario: attachProposal change after mount does not flip mode

- **WHEN** the dialog mounted with `attachProposal = undefined` (mode = `"checkout"`) AND the parent re-renders with `attachProposal = "add-foo"`
- **THEN** `mode` SHALL remain `"checkout"` (user-controlled after first paint)
- **AND** the existing `attachProposal`-reactivity on the branch input SHALL still apply if the user later flips to `"fork"` mode
