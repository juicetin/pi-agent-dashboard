/**
 * Keyboard + assistive-tech path to the attachment zoom.
 *
 * The thumbnail carried `onClick` on a bare `<img>`, which is reachable by
 * mouse only: no tab stop, no Enter/Space, nothing for a screen reader to
 * announce as actionable. Click-to-zoom is the ONLY way to reach the
 * full-resolution original, so keyboard users had no path to it at all.
 *
 * The fix is a real `<button>` rather than `tabIndex` + an `onKeyDown` that
 * re-implements activation. These tests therefore assert the ELEMENT, not
 * synthesized key events: Enter/Space activation is the browser's contract for
 * a native button, and jsdom does not synthesize it — a `fireEvent.keyDown`
 * assertion here would pass on a div with a hand-rolled handler and prove
 * nothing about real AT behaviour.
 *
 * See change: fit-attachments-for-display (CodeRabbit round 2, a11y).
