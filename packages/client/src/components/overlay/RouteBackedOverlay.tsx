/**
 * Route-backed overlay container (design D1, option C).
 *
 * A route-backed overlay points the URL at itself, so the launching route stops
 * matching and cannot render from `window.location`. This component supplies the
 * second, URL-independent rendering source that lets the launching surface stay
 * visible anyway: the underlay is wrapped in a nested wouter `<Router>` whose
 * location hooks are pinned to a FROZEN path via `memoryLocation`.
 *
 * Consequences worth stating, because they are the contract:
 *   - Exactly ONE branch is ever derived from `window.location` — the overlay.
 *     The underlay is derived from the frozen background, which is what keeps
 *     `shell-overlay-route` / `url-routing` true under their amended wording.
 *   - BOTH halves of the location are pinned. `searchHook` matters because
 *     `/folder/:cwd/view?path=`, `/pi-view?url=` and `/pi-resource?path=` carry
 *     query strings; pinning only the path would render a frozen path against
 *     the overlay's own query.
 *   - `static: true` makes the pinned router refuse navigation, so a stray
 *     `navigate` from inside the underlay cannot move it out from under the
 *     overlay.
 *
 * Focus trap, Escape (via the shared escape-stack), backdrop click and the ✕
 * affordance all come from the shared `Dialog` — this component deliberately
 * does not reimplement them.
 *
 * See change: add-route-backed-overlay-dialogs.
