/**
 * ScopedResourceGrid — the single wiring for both resource entry points (D7).
 *
 * Ten destinations reach one grid: five global `/settings/<page>` paths and
 * five folder-scoped `/folder/<cwd>/settings/<page>` mirrors. C4 resolved the
 * shape as two entry points into one panel with a scope PRESET, so the URLs
 * stay distinct and the scope is not a user-facing switch — it is read off the
 * matched route.
 *
 * Before this, both call sites hand-assembled the same five props and each kept
 * its OWN page→type map. Two byte-identical maps can drift silently: nothing
 * type-checks one against the other, and a drifted entry renders the wrong
 * resource type under a correct-looking URL. `RESOURCE_PAGE_TYPE` below is now
 * the only copy, and `resource-scope-routes.spec.ts` pins every path against
 * the type its own URL names.
 *
 * The caller still owns the fetch: the folder surface derives its nav count
 * pills from the same `usePiResources` result, so hoisting the fetch in here
 * would either duplicate it or force the counts back out through a callback.
 *
 * See change: add-route-backed-overlay-dialogs (task 7.1).
