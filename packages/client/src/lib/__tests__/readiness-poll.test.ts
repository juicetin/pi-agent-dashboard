/**
 * Readiness poll lifecycle — folded from test-plan.md
 * (add-zrok-custom-reserved-name): F1–F3, F6 (the label arm), plus 6.4/6.5.
 *
 * A tick shells out per provider, so the expensive question is not "does it
 * poll" but "does it ever poll when nobody is looking". These assert the two
 * ways that leaks: a timer that outlives the dialog, and an in-flight tick that
 * gets overtaken by its own successor (a tick is bounded at 4s per provider
 * against a 5s interval, so overlap is reachable, not theoretical).
