/**
 * The overlay's pinned background location.
 *
 * A route-backed overlay points the URL at itself, so the launching route stops
 * matching and cannot render from `window.location`. Design D1 (option C)
 * resolves this by FREEZING the launching location at navigation time and
 * rendering the underlay from that frozen path through a wouter `<Router hook>`
 * that is independent of `window.location`.
 *
 * This module owns only the pure resolution:
 *   - `captureBackground(url)` records the location being left, once;
 *   - `resolveBackground(currentRoute)` returns what the underlay should render,
 *     preferring the capture and falling back to `computeBackTarget` on a cold
 *     load (`page.goto("/settings/security")` — nothing was captured).
 *
 * The capture is deliberately NOT refreshed while an overlay is open: an
 * in-overlay navigation (settings → plugin settings) must leave the underlay and
 * the dismissal target alone, or one `Esc` would land mid-surface instead of
 * back at the launching route.
 *
 * Both halves of the location are pinned. Three converted routes carry query
 * strings (`/folder/:cwd/view?path=`, `/pi-view?url=`, `/pi-resource?path=`), so
 * pinning the path while letting the search string come from the live location
 * would render a frozen path against the overlay's own query.
 *
 * See change: add-route-backed-overlay-dialogs (D1, test-plan S-08 / S-08b).
