/**
 * subagent-inspector-telemetry — how much of a subagent's runtime has a detail
 * view MOUNTED.
 *
 * This is the signal the design's kill switch needs (D1/P5) and the one thing
 * the dashboard never recorded: stripping the timeline off intermediate frames
 * only wins while nobody is watching, because a mounted inspector pulls the fat
 * payload back on a cadence. If inspectors are open for most of a run, the fat
 * payload flows anyway and the change buys little — C4 fixes the abort
 * threshold at > 50 %.
 *
 * Measured client-side because "is a view mounted" exists nowhere else. Kept as
 * a pure in-memory aggregate with an explicit clock argument so it is testable
 * and costs nothing at runtime; the reading is also hung off `globalThis` so a
 * Playwright/harness run can read it out of the page.
 *
 * See change: reduce-subagent-details-payload.
