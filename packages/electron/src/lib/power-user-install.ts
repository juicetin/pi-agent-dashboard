/**
 * Power-user-mode managed install helper.
 *
 * TODO(simplify-electron-bootstrap-derived-state Phase C): This file is still
 * imported by the LAUNCH_SOURCE_V2=false legacy path (main.ts).
 * Delete after the legacy path is removed in a follow-up change.
 *
 *
 * The Electron app's wizard auto-skips its UI when `pi.found && bridge.found`.
 * Pre-fix, that auto-skip ALSO skipped `installStandalone()`, leaving
 * `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` empty. The bundled server then fell back
 * to the user's system pi for the TS loader, hitting jiti-version drift
 * (the original failure mode was `pi-coding-agent@0.71.x` shipping
 * `jiti@2.6.5`, which misnormalised file:/// URLs on Windows — see
 * `node-spawn.ts::shouldUrlWrapEntry`). The crash was `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
 * before the dashboard could start.
 *
 * The current managed pin is `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.74.x`
 * (jiti `^2.7.0`); the 0.71.x / 2.6.5 reference is kept as the canonical
 * known-broken marker.
 *
 * Fix: every first launch SHALL run `installStandalone()` regardless of
 * wizard-UI state. This module:
 *
 *   - Decides whether to run the install (pure helper `decideStartupAction`)
 *   - Runs it with a small wrapper that adds idempotency on populated dirs
 *
 * Pure helpers are exported so unit tests can exercise the decision matrix
 * (firstRun × pi.found × bridge.found × managed-dir-populated) without any
 * filesystem or npm-spawn side effects.
 *
 * See change: fix-electron-windows-installer-and-server-bootstrap (Defect 1).
