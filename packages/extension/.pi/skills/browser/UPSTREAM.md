# Upstream provenance — `browser` skill

The `references/web.md` and `references/electron.md` files are vendored
snapshots of upstream `agent-browser` skill content. The Pi Dashboard
addenda appended to `web.md` and the "Worked example: Pi Dashboard"
section in `electron.md` are project-specific and not from upstream.

**Not vendored — do not overwrite on refresh:**
`references/own-browser.md` and `scripts/check-panerelay.sh` are authored
for this repo (the Panerelay / own-logged-in-browser recipe). They have no
upstream counterpart.

## How to refresh

When upstream releases a new `agent-browser` version with material changes
to the `core` or `electron` skills, refresh the vendored content:

```bash
# 1. Install / upgrade upstream
npm install -g agent-browser@latest
agent-browser --version

# 2. Capture
agent-browser skills get core --full > /tmp/core.md
agent-browser skills get electron     > /tmp/electron.md

# 3. Diff against the vendored copies (in this directory)
diff <(awk 'BEGIN{n=0} /^---$/{n++; next} n>=2{print}' /tmp/core.md)     references/web.md
diff <(awk 'BEGIN{n=0} /^---$/{n++; next} n>=2{print}' /tmp/electron.md) references/electron.md

# 4. If meaningful, replace the vendored bodies and update the table above.
#    Preserve the Pi Dashboard addenda (after the first `---` separator
#    in web.md, and the "Worked example: Pi Dashboard" section in
#    electron.md). Update the LICENSE file if the upstream license text
#    has changed. Leave own-browser.md and check-panerelay.sh untouched.

# 5. Re-verify the authored recipe against the new CLI, then bump
#    `verifiedAgainstCli` in SKILL.md frontmatter:
#    bash scripts/check-panerelay.sh
```

The CLI version is the source of truth for the content; the upstream tag
SHA is recorded so a future maintainer can also fetch the static
`skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md` discovery stub at the same revision.
