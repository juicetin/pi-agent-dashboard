/**
 * Automatic session topic-naming (bridge-side).
 *
 * After each terminal turn (`agent_end`), an eligible session asks the naming
 * model (`@naming`, falling back to `@fast`) for a short topic title and
 * applies it via `pi.setSessionName(...)`. The name is the real pi session
 * name, mirrored to the dashboard through the existing `session_name_update`
 * path. The first successful name ends the loop permanently for that session.
 *
 * Naming is BOUNDED: a reasoning model can burn the whole output cap on
 * reasoning tokens and end truncated with no text, so truncation is a
 * first-class `starved` verdict and each session gets a total attempt budget.
 * Exhausting it stops naming permanently with an actionable error instead of
 * retrying silently forever.
 *
 * Placement is pure-bridge: the model call runs in-process via pi-ai's
 * `streamSimple` + the model registry's credential resolution — the same
 * primitives the server's model-proxy uses, minus the HTTP round-trip. No
 * dependency on the dashboard server being reachable.
 *
 * This file holds the PURE, unit-testable pieces (pre-filter, parse, transcript
 * window, model call, eligibility, provenance classifier) plus a small stateful
 * factory (`createAutoNamer`) that the bridge owns once per session.
 *
 * See change: add-auto-session-naming, fix-auto-naming-reasoning-model.
