/**
 * Polyfill for `ctx.ui.multiselect(...)` — a method the dashboard bridge's
 * `ask_user` tool advertises but which `pi-coding-agent`'s
 * `ExtensionUIContext` does not expose. Without this, any TUI dispatch of
 * `method: "multiselect"` crashes with `"ctx.ui.multiselect is not a function"`.
 *
 * Fallback chain (introduced by change fix-multiselect-auto-cancel-on-dashboard):
 *
 *   1. PRIMARY  — bridge-patched `ctx.ui.multiselect` (PromptBus path).
 *      The bridge attaches this method on session_start so the dashboard
 *      browser renders a real `MultiselectRenderer` dialog and the TUI
 *      adapter renders a `MultiSelectList` overlay in the terminal.
 *
 *   2. FALLBACK — legacy `ctx.ui.custom` + `MultiSelectList` overlay.
 *      Reached when (a) running against an older pi without the bridge
 *      patch, (b) running outside the bridge entirely, or (c) the bridge
 *      patch was removed for some reason. TUI-only — does NOT render a
 *      browser dialog in dashboard / RPC mode (which is exactly the bug
 *      that motivated the primary path).
 *
 * The result contract is unchanged in either branch:
 *   - resolves to `string[]` when the user confirms a selection
 *     (possibly empty if nothing is checked)
 *   - resolves to `undefined` when the user cancels (Escape / Cancel)
 *
 * See change: fix-multiselect-auto-cancel-on-dashboard.
