/**
 * Explicit session move: overlap the two connections, then commit (D11).
 *
 * `ConnectionManager` owns exactly one socket, and a re-target (`retargetTo()`
 * — formerly `updateUrl()`) tears the socket down. That is a GAP, not a
 * handover — the origin dies before the target exists, and whatever is sent
 * meanwhile is buffered against a socket that never returns.
 *
 * So the move is coordinated ABOVE the connection rather than inside it: two
 * connections exist briefly, and the swap happens at a single instant. The
 * invariant that matters is send ownership (task 9.3c):
 *
 *   **exactly one connection owns sends at every instant.**
 *
 * Two owners duplicates a prompt; zero owners drops it. Both fail silently,
 * which is why ownership is an explicit piece of state here and not an
 * emergent consequence of which sockets happen to be open.
 *
 * The sequencing is deliberately pessimistic — the origin keeps serving until
 * the target has *proven* it can take over:
 *
 *   1. connect the target and open a PROVISIONAL registration (claims nothing);
 *   2. verify the answering instance is the one we expect (D14 — an address is
 *      not an identity);
 *   3. commit; only now does ownership move and the origin close.
 *
 * Every failure — refusal, wrong identity, timeout, transport error — takes the
 * same path: drop the target, keep the origin, stay usable. A move that cannot
 * complete must be a no-op, never an outage.
 *
 * See change: add-pi-gateway-transport-identity (tasks 9.3b, 9.3c).
