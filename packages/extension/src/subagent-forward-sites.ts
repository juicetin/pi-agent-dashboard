 *
 * Placement is a decision, not a detail (D2). There is no single chokepoint:
 *  - a strip inside `sendEventForward` would strip the RESYNC REPLY, which is
 *    the one frame the whole pull model depends on staying fat;
 *  - a strip on the EventBus path alone would leak every frame drained by the
 *    buffered-frame flush.
 *
 * So the strip is applied here, per call site, and never in the transport.
