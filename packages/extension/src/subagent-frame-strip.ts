/**
 * subagent-frame-strip — drop the cumulative `details.entries[]` timeline from
 * frames describing a NON-terminal subagent, on the FORWARD path only.
 *
 * Why here (D2): the producer builds one `snapshotDetails()` object and hands
 * it to BOTH carriers (the `subagents:*` EventBus frame and the pi-core
 * `tool_execution_update`), so per-tick bytes grow linearly with run length on
 * both wire segments and in every stored event. The bridge is downstream of
 * every producer version that exists, is our code, and already retains the fat
 * snapshot for resync — so stripping here needs no producer release, no wire
 * key, no version negotiation.
 *
 * Two invariants this module exists to hold:
 *  - **Allowlist, never a negation.** `AgentStatus` also carries `"stopped"`
 *    (unemitted today); a `!terminal` test would silently strip it and lose
 *    that run's timeline forever. Only `queued`/`running` are stripped, and an
 *    absent/unknown status is never stripped.
 *  - **Clone, never mutate.** `SubagentFrameBuffer` retains frames BY
 *    REFERENCE, so an in-place strip would corrupt the very snapshot the pull
 *    path serves.
 *
 * NOT applied to terminal frames (the durable record behind `tool_execution_end`
 * backfill) nor to resync replies (the pull model's own answer).
 *
 * See change: reduce-subagent-details-payload.
