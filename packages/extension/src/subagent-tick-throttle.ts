/**
 * SubagentTickThrottle — bounds the rate of subagent `Agent` ticks on the
 * `tool_execution_update` carrier.
 *
 * Background: a running subagent feeds the dashboard over TWO carriers fed by
 * one `snapshotDetails()` object in the producer. The `subagents:*` carrier is
 * already coalesced to 250 ms by the producer's own emitter; the
 * `tool_execution_update` carrier has no throttle anywhere on its path, so its
 * rate is the subagent's RAW session-event rate (streaming `message_update`
 * deltas included) against a payload carrying the cumulative timeline.
 *
 * This class is that missing throttle, applied at the bridge (our code, seeing
 * every frame, downstream of every producer version in the wild — no producer
 * release needed). Semantics mirror the producer's proven `createProgressEmitter`
 * shape: leading edge fires immediately, within the window only the LATEST
 * frame is retained (safe because every frame is a FULL snapshot), and a
 * trailing timer emits it at window end.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and easy to lose:
 *
 *  - **Nothing after terminal.** On `tool_execution_end` a HELD frame is
 *    DISCARDED, not flushed. This carrier never carries terminal state, so the
 *    pending frame is a strictly stale intermediate snapshot; flushing it would
 *    race the very overwrite the discard prevents (a stale tick landing after
 *    the end event visibly re-opens a finished tool row).
 *  - **Gates are re-checked at FIRE time, not at hold time.** `sessionReady`,
 *    bridge liveness and the session id can all move while a frame is held, and
 *    the send must go over the LIVE connection rather than a captured
 *    reference. A failed gate drops the frame and counts it — that loss is
 *    acceptable only because this carrier is not the recovery path (the
 *    ephemeral carrier's retained snapshot is), and only because the counter
 *    makes it visible.
 *
 * The key map is bounded independently of the terminal hook by an idle TTL, so
 * a run whose end event never arrived (e.g. dropped at the not-ready gate)
 * cannot leak one dead entry per run into a long session.
 *
 * See change: reduce-bridge-tick-bandwidth (D2/D3/D4/D6).
