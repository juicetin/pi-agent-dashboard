/**
 * Plugin-internal UI selection state shared across flow components.
 *
 * Today these flags live in `App.tsx` as `useState` declarations
 * threaded down as props (lines 232, 233, 244, 243 in pre-deletion
 * App.tsx). After Part F's component refactor + Part H's shell
 * deletions, this context becomes the sole owner of these flags.
 *
 * Scope: per dashboard mount (NOT per session). Selecting an agent in
 * one flow detail view doesn't affect another session's selection
 * because the user can only view one session at a time — the slot
 * consumer's `session` prop tells each component which session it's
 * rendering for, but the selection flags themselves are global to the
 * "currently focused content view." This matches the shell's current
 * behavior; no per-session state is needed.
 *
 * The provider lives at the root of the flows-plugin contribution
 * tree. Per the proposal Decision 5 alternative (rejected the
 * `PluginRoot` runtime convention), the provider is mounted by
 * wrapping each top-level claim's exported component. A single shared
 * provider is acceptable because React contexts mount once and then
 * any descendant consumer reads from that one instance — multiple
 * mount points only cost a few extra Provider wrappers, not duplicate
 * state.
 *
 * Actually, Decision 5 was DROPPED. Without `PluginRoot`, multiple
 * mount points would create multiple providers with independent state.
 * Solution: hoist into a module-level store (the pattern used by
 * `session-events-store.ts` in plugin-runtime). React `useSyncExternalStore`
 * subscribes; setters mutate the module-level state and notify
 * subscribers.
 *
 * See change: pluginize-flows-via-registry.
