// ── content-view claim predicates ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Each `content-view` claim in the manifest references one of these
// predicates via the `predicate` field. The slot consumer calls the
// predicate at render time; the first claim (priority order) whose
// predicate returns `true` renders. If none return `true`, the slot
// renders nothing and the shell's fallback shows the chat.
//
// Each predicate reads the plugin's UI-state store imperatively (via
// `getFlowsUiStateSnapshot` — not a hook, safe outside React) so it
// can run from the slot-registry filter. The `_session` argument is
// passed by the slot system per the predicate contract
// (`(props) => boolean`) but is unused here because activation lives
// in plugin state, not session state.
//
// See change: pluginize-flows-via-registry (design.md Decision 3
// RECONSIDERED — predicates over routes).
