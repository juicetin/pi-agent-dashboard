/**
 * Pure render function: SessionFlowActions intent.
 *
 * Translates (flows, commands) into an intent tree for the
 * session-card-action-bar slot. No React, no DOM — just JSON.
 *
 * The intent uses a `ui:action-list` whose items each emit their own
 * action descriptor in the intent format. Items are NOT IntentNodes
 * themselves — they're plain data; the ActionList primitive turns
 * `onClick: ActionDescriptor` data into a real function via the
 * `IntentRenderer.actions` wiring.
 *
 * For per-item action wiring without IntentNode wrapping, we emit a
 * `data-action` field on the item, and the registered ActionList
 * primitive translates it to onClick. Alternatively, each button could
 * be its own IntentNode — but `ui:action-list` is meant as a high-
 * affinity primitive that takes a flat data array.
 *
 * See change: adopt-server-driven-intent-rendering.
