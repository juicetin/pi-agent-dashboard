/**
 * GoalControl (demoted) — read-only link chip to the owning goal.
 *
 * After add-goals-folder-page (task 2.2) the session-card action-bar no
 * longer hosts the "Set a goal…" input or the set/pause/done/clear controls.
 * It renders nothing without an owning `goalId`, and a single link chip that
 * navigates to the goal's detail route when `goalId` is present.
 *
 * See change: add-goals-folder-page.
