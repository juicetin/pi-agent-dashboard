/**
 * Fastify route registration for `/mcp`.

 * The 405 requirement needs EXPLICIT handlers, and this is the subtlest part of

 * `setNotFoundHandler` (`packages/server/src/server.ts`), which in `--dev`
 * proxies to Vite and returns **200 with SPA HTML**. That is a conformance
 * failure that looks like success: a client asking for the MCP endpoint gets a
 * web page and a 200. Registering every non-POST method explicitly is what
 * keeps E1-E4 honest in both modes.
