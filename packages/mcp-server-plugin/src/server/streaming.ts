/**
 * `subscriptions/listen` — a long-lived POST-response stream (SEP: the GET
 * endpoint and `resources/subscribe` are both gone in 2026-07-28).
 *
 * The load-bearing property is LIFETIME. `ctx.onEvent` delivers **every**
 * session's events to every listener, so two things must hold or this becomes
 * both a leak and a data-disclosure bug:
 *
 *   1. **Filtering is per subscription** (S2). A subscriber receives only the
 *      sessions it named. This is a spec requirement, not an optimisation.
 *   2. **The subscription dies with its request** (S4, S5, S6). It is released
 *      on a clean close, on a transport abort, and on server shutdown — all
 *      three funnel through one `close()` so no path can forget.
 *
 * Statelessness is preserved because the subscription is scoped to the single
 * request that opened it. Nothing is shared between requests.
