/**
 * Regression test for the postinstall `fix-pty-permissions.cjs` script.
 *
 * Ensures that after `npm install` the native `spawn-helper` binary in the
 * current platform's `node-pty` prebuild directory has at least one execute
 * bit set. Without this, `pty.spawn(...)` fails with "posix_spawnp failed."
 * and the dashboard's "New Terminal" button appears dead.
