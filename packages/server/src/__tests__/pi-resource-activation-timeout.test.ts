/**
 * `resolveActivation()` sits on the `/api/pi-resources` critical path and can
 * perform network I/O for temporary git sources, so it is bounded by
 * `RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS`. Expiry must read exactly like a throw — `null`, which
 * the scanner reports as degraded — rather than hanging the payload.
 *
 * Every scanner test injects its own resolver, so this is the only coverage of
 * the real timer path. The seam is the tool registry: `resolveActivation`
 * loads pi through it, so a fake module there exercises the whole function.
 * See change: fix-skill-discovery-parity (test-plan C1).
