/**
 * Recovery of full-resolution attachment originals.
 *
 * D7: the session transcript IS the record — pi already writes full-resolution
 * bytes there — so nothing durable needs to be added. Any blob cache layered on
 * top is an optimisation whose miss is recoverable from here.
 *
 * Security posture (this module is the trust boundary for a binary surface):
 *  - Attachment ids are content hashes, validated against a strict 64-char
 *    lowercase-hex shape. Nothing derived from request input ever reaches a
 *    filesystem path, so traversal is structurally impossible (X3).
 *  - Lookup is scoped to ONE session's transcript, so a valid digest belonging
 *    to another session simply is not found — cross-session reads are refused
 *    without needing a separate ownership table (X2).
 *  - Only allow-listed raster image types are recoverable. A blob claiming
 *    `text/html` (or `image/svg+xml`, which is scriptable) is never returned,
 *    so the endpoint cannot be used to serve active content (E15).
 *
 * See change: fit-attachments-for-display (task 5.7, D7/D8).
