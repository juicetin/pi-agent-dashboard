/**
 * Server-side home of the bind-vs-trust reachability fact.
 *
 * The predicate itself lives in `shared/bind-reachability.ts` — this module only
 * supplies the server's INPUTS to it (the boot-frozen bind host, the `--host`
 * flag, `PI_DASHBOARD_HOST`, the live config) and owns the two server surfaces:
 * the `[bind-reachability]` startup warning and the `reachability` object on the
 * guarded `GET /api/config`.
 *
 * `resolvedBindHost` is frozen at boot — it is what THIS process actually bound.
 * `pendingBindHost` is re-resolved on every read against the current config, so
 * an operator who edits `bindHost` sees the advisory converge before the restart
 * that would apply it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT on `/api/health`: that route carries no `preHandler`, and the
 * resolved bind host plus the unreachable entries describe the operator's
 * private network topology, not the server's own health. Publishing them
 * unguarded would hand any peer that can reach the port a map of the internal
 * subnets — including, in the flagship configuration, the very host the guard
 * just denied. See change: warn-unreachable-trusted-networks.
