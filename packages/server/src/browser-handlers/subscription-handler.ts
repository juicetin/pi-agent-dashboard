 *   - the tail's leading edge snaps FORWARD to the next `message_start` /

 *     events beyond the budget — a user setting 500 could receive ~700, making
 *     `maxReplayEvents` a soft floor. Forward drops a few of the oldest tail
 *     events instead, so the budget stays a HARD cap.
 *   - the head's trailing edge snaps BACKWARD to a completed `message_end`, so
 *     the head cannot end on a dangling `message_start` and strand a
 *     permanently "streaming" row in the UI.
 *
 * Both are BEST-EFFORT: neither may find a boundary within `SNAP_LOOKUP`, so
 * the reducer must tolerate an orphan at either edge. Snapping raises quality;
 * reducer tolerance is the correctness guarantee.
 * MODE selects the SHAPE. In `tail-only` the whole budget goes to the tail and
 * `headEnd` is `0`: `HEAD_RATIO` / `HEAD_MIN` / `HEAD_CAP` are not consulted at
 * all, and the head-edge backward snap becomes INAPPLICABLE rather than
 * violated — there is no head edge to snap. The fits-entirely short-circuit
 * and the tail-edge forward snap are UNCONDITIONAL: the first makes the overlap
 * case unrepresentable and the second is what keeps the budget a hard cap, and
