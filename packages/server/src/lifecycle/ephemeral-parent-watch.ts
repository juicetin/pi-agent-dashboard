/**
 * Ephemeral boot-parent watch (D5, fix-autostart-discovery-precedence).
 *
 * A server started with `--ephemeral` exists only to serve the agent that
 * booted it. When that boot parent dies, the server would otherwise leak its
 * ports and memory forever. This watch is a small INDEPENDENT, unconditional
 * interval — the idle timer (`createIdleTimer`) CANNOT host the check: its
 * `start()` early-returns when `config.autoShutdown` is false (the default,
 * and the exact isolated-verification config ephemeral targets) and it
 * terminates via raw `process.exit(0)`, the leak/undrained-exit path this
 * design forbids. The interval cadence IS the stated exit-latency bound.
 *
 * On a PROVEN-dead parent (kill-decision liveness, D6) it invokes
 * `onParentDead` exactly once — wired by `server.ts` to
 * `server.stop({ exitIntent: "ephemeral" })` so spawned sessions drain and
 * the exit suppresses crash recovery. Standalone and Electron-hosted servers
 * are excluded by construction: nothing passes the flag for them.
