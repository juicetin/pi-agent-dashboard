/**
 * Who may open a bridge WebSocket, decided per transport.
 *
 * The gateway accepted ANY connection that could reach it and let it register
 * an arbitrary `sessionId` — harmless while it only ever listened on
 * loopback, fatal as the container's `0.0.0.0:9999` default. This is the gate
 * that makes the TCP listener defensible (D10b, task 6.3).
 *
 * Three rules, and the asymmetry between them is the whole point:
 *
 *   - **unix socket → allowed with no credential.** The kernel already decided
 *     via `0600` in a `0700` dir (D5). Asking for a token here would
 *     re-introduce the secret the transport exists to delete.
 *   - **remote TCP → a valid, unexpired, single-use, bridge-scoped ticket.**
 *     No grace, ever. A remote peer is exactly the threat.
 *   - **loopback TCP → a bounded deprecation window.** A bridge predating this
 *     change cannot mint a ticket, and refusing them at server-update time
 *     breaks every un-upgraded local session at once — a worse failure than
 *     the window, since loopback was the only thing reachable before. Bounded
 *     by the horizon in D10b, not open-ended.
 *
 * Pure by construction: the refusal cause must be reportable, and an emergent
 * one cannot be.
 *
 * See change: add-pi-gateway-transport-identity (D5, D7, D10b).
