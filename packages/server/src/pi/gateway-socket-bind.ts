/**
 * Bind the gateway's unix-domain socket without ever destroying a live one.
 *
 * The naive sequence — "unlink any pre-existing socket file, then bind" — is a
 * silent takeover primitive, and `EADDRINUSE` cannot be used to guard it:
 * `bind()` raises `EADDRINUSE` only when the path EXISTS, so a process binding
 * inside the `[probe → unlink]` window has its live socket unlinked and our
 * bind then *succeeds* with no error to catch (defect B3):
 *
 *   A: connect()  → ECONNREFUSED   (concludes stale)
 *   B: bind()                       (live listener)
 *   A: unlink()                     (destroys B's path)
 *   A: bind()                       (SUCCEEDS — silent capture)
 *
 * So the sequence is SERIALIZED, not guarded: probe, unlink and bind all run
 * while holding an exclusive lock on a companion file (a socket cannot itself
 * be locked). The lock covers only that sequence, never the listener's
 * lifetime.
 *
 * The probe is also not a liveness oracle — a live listener with a saturated
 * backlog also answers `ECONNREFUSED`. Only `ENOENT` (no file) and a refusal
 * on a path whose file exists but has *no* listener authorise an unlink, and
 * anything indeterminate fails closed with a conflict (D9, task 2.4c).
 *
 * Fail-closed alone, however, makes a stale path UNRECLAIMABLE — `ENOENT` and
 * "the file exists" are mutually exclusive, so a SIGKILLed dashboard wedges its
 * own path forever. The discriminator is a companion `<socketPath>.pid`: an
 * indeterminate probe may unlink only when that pid is recorded and provably
 * dead. A `live` probe always wins over it.
 *
 * On mixed versions there is no competitor: a dashboard predating this change
 * binds a TCP port and never touches a socket path at all.
 *
 * See change: add-pi-gateway-transport-identity (D9, defect B3).
