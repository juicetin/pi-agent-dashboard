/**
 * Build the `/api/network-interfaces` payload.
 *
 * Extracted from the route so the enumeration failure mode (#X4) is testable
 * without standing a server up: `os.networkInterfaces()` can throw (sandboxed
 * or permission-restricted hosts), and that must surface as an error response
 * rather than an unhandled throw.
 *
 * ONE ENTRY PER ADDRESS, deliberately. The endpoint has two consumers — the
 * trusted-networks dropdown wants one row per offer, but the listen-interface
 * picker renders one option per address and keys on it. Deduplicating here
 * would make a real bind address unselectable, so the dropdown dedupes at
 * render time instead (Decision 12).
 *
 * See change: warn-unreachable-trusted-networks.
