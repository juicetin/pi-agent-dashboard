/**
 * The single server-side reload entry point.
 *
 * Every reload trigger — the reload button / `/reload` in the composer,
 * `scripts/reload-all.sh`, the pi retry-policy settings save, package
 * install/remove, and `POST /api/resources/reload` — routes through
 * `dispatchReload`. (pi-core update is a *runtime swap*, not a reload, and is
 * routed to `respawnForRuntimeSwap` directly by its own call site.)
 *
 * Resolution ladder:
 *   1. Busy (streaming with a live bridge, or compacting) → refuse. Respawning
 *      mid-run destroys in-flight work. The refusal deliberately does NOT fire
 *      on a *stale* `streaming` — a session whose bridge died before
 *      `agent_end` is pinned there forever and is exactly what the respawn
 *      path exists to rescue.
 *   2. Headless PID → kill-and-respawn. This is the only mechanism that
 *      actually reloads a headless session (see below).
 *   3. No PID but a live bridge → forward `/reload` (terminal-hosted case).
 *      The bridge reloads in-process IF a human once typed
 *      `/__dashboard_reload` in its TUI, and reports an honest error if not.
 *   4. Neither → a terminal `error`. A session with NO registered PID is NEVER
 *      respawned: that would start a second pi process against a
 *      terminal-hosted session's file.
 *
 * ## Why there is no in-process path for headless sessions
 *
 * An earlier revision wrote `/__dashboard_reload` to the session's RPC keeper,
 * on the claim that pi's RPC mode runs a dispatched line through
 * `session.prompt()` WITH command handling. Measured in the docker harness
 * with `keeperLog.capturePiOutput = true`: it does not. pi delivered the
 * literal text to the MODEL as an ordinary user prompt and produced a full
 * agent turn. A pi BUILT-IN (`/help`) written to the same socket behaved
 * identically, so this is not the `__` prefix and not our registration.
 *
 * Dispatching a reload that way would inject a junk user message into the
 * operator's transcript, burn a model round-trip, and report `completed`
 * because the socket write succeeded — strictly worse than the silent no-op it
 * was meant to fix. Do not reintroduce it without re-measuring pi first.
 *
 * Feedback contract: exactly one terminal `command_feedback` per reload,
 * always keyed `/reload` regardless of which path resolved it.
 *
 * See change: fix-out-of-band-reload.
