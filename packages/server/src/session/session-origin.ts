/**
 * Which machine a session came from, and whether its files are ours to read.
 *
 * `session.sessionFile` is a path on the ORIGIN host. For a local session that
 * is the same host and every existing filesystem read is correct. For a remote
 * one it is a path on someone else's disk — and the dangerous case is not a
 * missing file but a PRESENT one: two machines with the same username produce
 * identical paths, so the server can open a real, unrelated transcript and
 * serve it as the remote session's own (#E15).
 *
 * Attribution comes from the CREDENTIAL the connection authenticated with, not
 * from anything the bridge says about itself. A self-reported origin is a claim
 * by the party being identified, and accepting it would let a remote bridge
 * launder itself local and re-open every path this gate closes.
 *
 * See change: add-pi-gateway-transport-identity (D12/D13; tasks 11.7, 11.8).
