/**
 * Synchronous spawn preflight check.
 *
 * Runs before every `spawnPiSession` invocation to catch fast-fail conditions
 * (bad cwd, missing binaries) without racing the spawn itself. All checks run
 * regardless of earlier failures so the caller gets all reasons in one pass.
 *
 * The ToolResolver passed in MUST have `useLoginShell: false` — preflight
 * must never spawn a login shell on the spawn-click hot path. If a resolver
 * with `useLoginShell: true` is passed, the check still runs but a one-time
 * warning is emitted.
 *
 * See change: spawn-failure-diagnostics.
