/**
 * Non-blocking CLI runner for the daemon providers' READINESS predicates.
 *
 * The synchronous `defaultRunner` in each provider stays exactly as it is for
 * the connect/disconnect lifecycle, where blocking is acceptable and the code
 * is already written around it. Readiness is different: it polls every 5s from
 * an interactive surface, and a synchronous `execFileSync` cannot be bounded by
 * racing it against a timer — the timer cannot fire while the event loop is
 * blocked, so a hung `tailscale status` freezes the ENTIRE server for its 30s
 * exec timeout, not merely one row of the board.
 *
 * This runner kills the child at the bound, so the bound is real.
 *
 * See change: add-zrok-custom-reserved-name (D6).
