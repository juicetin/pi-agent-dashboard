/**
 * Per-provider readiness — what is installed, enrolled and connected.
 *
 * The board composes the three predicates the provider seam ALREADY declares,
 * which all four providers already implement. `detectBinary` and `isEnrolled`
 * previously had one consumer each — connect-time preconditions — and nothing
 * surfaced them, so the Gateway's provider chips rendered from a hardcoded list
 * and looked identical whether a provider was installed or absent.
 *
 * Two corrections to "this needs no new detection logic", both found at source:
 *
 *  1. `status().active` is in-memory state recording only whether THIS process
 *     completed a `connect()`. A daemon started in a terminal reads
 *     `disconnected` forever; a daemon that died reads `connected` forever.
 *     Daemon providers therefore use `probeLive()`.
 *  2. `registry.rescan()` cannot reach a provider's module-scope binary memo.
 *     zrok and ngrok both hold one, so readiness calls their public
 *     invalidation entry point too.
 *
 * Every predicate is bounded below the poll interval and failure is per
 * provider: a throwing OR hung predicate degrades its own row and never blanks
 * the board.
 *
 * See change: add-zrok-custom-reserved-name (D6).
