/**
 * Bulk-skip manifest for cells NOT yet covered by a family-test file.

 * cube starts SKIPPED with a documented reason. As family-test files
 * are added, they call `register(cell, tag)` and the corresponding
 * skip entry is automatically overridden (because registration takes
 * precedence in the sweep).
 *
 * New cells added to the enumeration (by extending PLATFORMS,
 * DASH_LOCATIONS, etc. in `scenarios.ts`) will fail the cube-sweep
 * test until a decision is made here or in a family file.
 *
 * Call ordering invariant: this module MUST be imported before
 * `sweepCube()` runs. Family-test files can import-and-register after
 * this module runs — registration wins.
