/**
 * Repo-level invariant: build-time scripts (CI workflows, Dockerfiles,
 * shell scripts, root-level CJS helpers) MUST NOT hardcode
 * `node_modules/electron` or `node_modules/node-pty` paths. Instead, they
 * MUST resolve through the tool registry — either via the shared shell
 * wrapper at `packages/shared/bin/pi-dashboard-resolve-tool.cjs`, or
 * (for postinstall paths that run before the shared package is built)
 * via `require.resolve("<pkg>/package.json")` matching the registry's
 * `bare-import` strategy semantics.
 *
 * This invariant exists because npm workspace hoisting moves these
 * packages between `packages/<workspace>/node_modules/<pkg>/` (nested)
 * and `<repoRoot>/node_modules/<pkg>/` (hoisted) depending on the
 * workspaces config and npm version. The v0.4.0 release crisis was
 * caused exactly by this: `cd packages/electron/node_modules/electron`
 * stopped working after `f51e352` switched workspace cross-refs to
 * plain semver.
 *
 * If this test fails, replace the offending substring with one of:
 *
 *   # Shell / YAML / Dockerfile (build-time, has access to repo source):
 *   ELECTRON_DIR=$(node packages/shared/bin/pi-dashboard-resolve-tool.cjs electron)
 *   cd "$ELECTRON_DIR" && ...
 *
 *   # CJS root postinstall (runs DURING npm install — must inline):
 *   const ptyPkg = require.resolve("node-pty/package.json");
 *   const prebuildsDir = path.join(path.dirname(ptyPkg), "prebuilds");
 *
 * See change: register-build-time-tools.
