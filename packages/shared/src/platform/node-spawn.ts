/**
 * Canonical helper for spawning `node --import <loader> <entry>` argv.
 *
 * Node ≥ 20's ESM loader parses BOTH the `--import` loader position AND
 * the entry-script position as URLs. Raw Windows paths like
 * `B:\Dev\foo.ts` URL-parse to scheme `b:`, which is not in the ESM
 * loader's allowlist (file, data, node) → the process crashes with
 * `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` before any filesystem access.
 *
 * Node's internal drive-letter heuristic catches the common cases
 * (`C:\`, `D:\`) but has known gaps for `A:`, `B:`, and other letters.
 * Rather than relying on the heuristic, we wrap the loader position
 * with `file://` unconditionally.
 *
 * The entry-script position needs a more nuanced rule. Node's default
 * resolver AND jiti's ESM hook both accept `file://` URL entries. But
 * **tsx's ESM hook rejects `file://` URLs as entries** — tsx's resolver
 * treats the entry as a user-typed specifier and attempts bare-import
 * / relative-path resolution, producing `<cwd>/file:/...` errors.
 * Since tsx is used as the jiti fallback on dev machines without pi
 * installed (the most common Linux dev path), we must NOT URL-wrap
 * the entry when the loader is tsx. Detection: the loader path
 * contains `/tsx/` (every tsx install ships its hook under a `tsx/`
 * directory; jiti's hook is under `jiti/`).
 *
 * This module is the canonical chokepoint. The repo-level lint test
 * `no-raw-node-import.test.ts` refuses any other call site that
 * passes a raw path to `--import` / `--loader`.
 *
 * See change: fix-windows-entry-script-url.

/**
 * Decide whether the entry-script position needs `file://` URL wrapping.
 *
 * Rule:
 *   - tsx loader: always raw path (tsx rejects file:// entries on every OS)
 *   - non-tsx (jiti / Node default) on POSIX: raw path
 *     (POSIX has no drive-letter / URL-scheme collision; jiti's resolver
 *      actively MISBEHAVES when handed `file://` URL entries — it
 *      normalises away the triple-slash and then treats `file:/...` as
 *      a relative specifier, producing `<cwd>/file:/...` ENOENT errors.)
 *   - non-tsx on Windows: file:// URL
 *     (Node parses drive letters like `B:` / `A:` as URL schemes in argv
 *      before loaders run, throwing ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME.
 *      Wrapping with `file://` sidesteps the parse.)
 *
 * Keeps a `platform` parameter for testability so unit tests on a POSIX
 * host can exercise the Windows branch without mutating `process.platform`.
 *
 * !! JITI VERSION CONTRACT !!
 * The Windows-non-tsx arm relies on jiti's `file:///` triple-slash URL
 * handling. Verified-good baselines (must be one of these in the
 * offline cacache):
 *   • `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.74.x` (jiti `^2.7.0`)  — current
 *   • `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@0.70.x`  (jiti 2.x)        — legacy
 *
 * Both ship a jiti that correctly normalises `file:///` entries on
 * Windows. The contract was originally carved around 0.70.x in change
 * `fix-windows-entry-script-url` and re-anchored at 0.74.x in change
 * `migrate-pi-fork-to-earendil` (E.7).
 *
 * Known-broken (do NOT pin): `pi-coding-agent@0.71.x` shipping
 * `jiti@2.6.5`. That jiti version misnormalises triple-slash to
 * single-slash and prepends cwd as if the entry were a relative
 * specifier, producing `<cwd>/file:/...` ENOENT errors. Keep the
 * 0.71.x / 2.6.5 mention here so contributors recognise the
 * regression pattern if it recurs in a future jiti.
 *
 * The Electron Windows codepath defends against version drift by
 * resolving jiti from the managed dir's pinned `pi-coding-agent`
 * (currently `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.74.0`, pinned in
 * `packages/electron/offline-packages.json` and extracted into
 * `~/.pi-dashboard/` by `installStandalone()` on first launch — see
 * Defect 1 of change `fix-electron-windows-installer-and-server-bootstrap`).
 * Since the managed-dir tree is pinned, the contract holds regardless
 * of what jiti is on the user's PATH.
 *
 * If a future change bumps the offline-cacache `pi-coding-agent` pin to
 * a version OUTSIDE the verified baselines, RE-VERIFY this contract on
 * Windows manually (run a packaged Electron app on Win10 + Win11) and
 * either:
 *   1. Update the contract (fix the file:// URL handling expectation), OR
 *   2. Add a per-jiti-version branch here, OR
 *   3. Switch the bundled loader to tsx (which has its own contract).
 *
 * Locked by `node-spawn-jiti-contract.test.ts`.
