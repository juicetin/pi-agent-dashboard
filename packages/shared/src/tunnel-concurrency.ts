/**
 * Resolving WHICH providers run, and in which mode, when several may be live.
 *
 * `tunnel.provider` is retained and redefined as **the primary**; extras opt in
 * via `tunnel.<id>.enabled`. That choice is what keeps this change small:
 * `getTunnelUrl()` returns the primary's URL, so every existing OAuth, cookie
 * and redirect-URI requirement stays true verbatim and the legacy
 * `reservedToken` migration is untouched.
 *
 * The one thing it does NOT leave untouched is mode. `tunnel.mode` is a single
 * field, and `PROVIDER_MODES` makes zerotier private-only while zrok and ngrok
 * are public-only — so "zrok primary + zerotier enabled" is inexpressible under
 * one shared mode. Hence `tunnel.<id>.mode`, defaulted only where a provider
 * has exactly ONE supported mode (inferring a mode for tailscale, which
 * supports both, would be a coin flip disguised as a default).
 *
 * See change: add-zrok-custom-reserved-name (D3).
