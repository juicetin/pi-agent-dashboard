# Scenarios E1 + E22 (test-plan: fix-worktree-server-autostart-leak).
#   E1  — server B starts against an occupied gateway port; a later startup
#         step fails; B must exit non-zero and leave only A's pid listening.
#   E22 — invariant: no process may hold the gateway port while never having
#         bound its dashboard port (the captured PID-78379 signature).
