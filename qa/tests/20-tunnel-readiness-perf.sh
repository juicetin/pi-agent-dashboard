# Test: per-provider readiness tick latency + concurrent-tunnel soak.
#
# Folded from test-plan.md (add-zrok-custom-reserved-name): P1, P3, X12.
#
# Readiness shells out once per provider per tick, from an interactive surface
# polling every 5s. That is affordable only if a tick stays well inside the
# interval, so the budget is a GATE, not a report: if p95 approaches the poll
# interval, the cadence has to move before the feature ships.
#
# Windows/soak note: the 30-minute P3 soak and the X12 watchdog-recycle arm need
# two REAL enrolled providers, which no CI runner has. They run only when
# PI_QA_TUNNEL_SOAK=1 and the operator has enrolled them; otherwise they are
# skipped loudly rather than silently passing.

# ── P1: p95 < 2s per tick ───────────────────────────────────────────
# The budget is per TICK across all known providers. Sampled over a window
# rather than once: a single sample cannot distinguish a slow tick from a slow
# machine, and p95 is the number the spec fixes.
#
# HONEST SCOPE, stated rather than implied. The spec records P1 as a COLD-cache
# measurement over a 10-minute window. This script cannot reset the server's
# in-process provider memo over HTTP, so what it measures by default is the
# WARM-cache steady state — a strictly weaker check, and a sequential sample
# rather than a timed window.
#
#   - Cold-cache p95 is measured at the unit level instead, where the registry
#     can actually be reset per tick (see the 6.7 measurement recorded in
#     tasks.md: p95 617ms over 30 cold ticks).
#   - Set PI_QA_WINDOW_MINUTES to sample over a real duration; the default is a
#     quick sequential probe suitable for a smoke run.
#
# Claiming the full contract here while measuring the easy half is exactly the
# vacuous-gate failure this file's own content-type check exists to prevent.
