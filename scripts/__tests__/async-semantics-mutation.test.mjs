/**
 * Mutation check for the test files this change edited (test-plan #X15).
 *
 * Design D3 names the highest-likelihood failure of this change: a promise fix
 * that removes the diagnostic AND the test's teeth at the same time. That is
 * invisible in a green run — the suite passes either way. So each touched test
 * file is checked the only way that can falsify it: break a behaviour the file
 * covers and require the file to go RED.
 *
 * A file that stays green under mutation fails this harness, which is exactly
 * the assertion X15 asks for.
 *
 * Slow by construction — each mutation is a full vitest invocation — so this
 * file carries generous per-test timeouts.
 *
 * See change: cleanup-async-semantics-server-extension (test-plan #X15).
