/**
 * Repo convention checks (test-plan #E4-#E8, #E10-#E15).
 *
 * Style mirrors `scripts/__tests__/lint-ledger.test.mjs` — drive the exported
 * rule fns directly rather than shelling out, so each detector is pinned
 * independently of git state.
 *
 * The negative cases carry the weight here. A naive "any box-drawing character"
 * rule flags README.md's directory tree; a naive "browser" rule would mandate
 * migrating three qa/ WebSocket smokes that belong in the per-OS VM matrix.
 * Both were caught by doubt-review and both are asserted below.
 *
 * See change: wire-local-review-gate.
