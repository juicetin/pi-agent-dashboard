/**
 * Dead-code oracle reproducibility inside the Docker harness (test-plan #H1).
 *
 * What this guards: the harness analysing a DIFFERENT TREE than the host, which
 * silently changes the verdict. It is not hypothetical — the image carried
 * `qa/fixtures` but no knip.json, no tests/, no public/, no .pi/skills, and no
 * playwright.config.ts or .github/, and reported 13 unused files / 233 exports
 * against the host's 10 / 227. A weaker assertion ("it runs", "exits 0") passes
 * happily against that wrong tree and proves nothing.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT assert: scalar equality of every class. Measured
 * — the `types` class differs by exactly one (`KbSettingsClaimProps`) between
 * host and container although the file md5s, the identifier's references,
 * typescript 5.9.3 and @types/react 19.2.17 are all identical, and each
 * environment is internally deterministic across repeat runs (host 189,
 * container 188). The only remaining difference is the Node minor (24.15 vs
 * 24.19). Exact cross-environment scalar equality is therefore not a property
 * Knip has, and asserting it would produce a permanently red or Node-pinned
 * gate for no signal.
 *
 * What IS asserted, because it holds and it is the high-signal half:
 *   - the unused-FILES set matches exactly (this is the class the tree shape
 *     actually moves — it went 90 → 10 when the graph was rooted)
 *   - every tree the knip.json entries name is present in the image
 *   - the ratchet passes inside the container
 *
 * Precondition, not a silent skip: this needs a running harness, which ship-it
 * step 3 stands up. `.pi-test-harness.json` is written by docker/test-up.sh.
 *
 * See change: add-knip-dead-code-oracle.
