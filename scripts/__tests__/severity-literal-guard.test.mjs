/**
 * Static guard — a raw red Tailwind literal may not re-enter a governed
 * tool-result error surface.
 *
 * Resolution of design Q1 (change: repair-tool-error-surfaces): the guard lives
 * here, as a vitest test, NOT as a fifth rule in scripts/check-conventions.mjs.
 * That file caps itself at four rules ("growth pressure here is a signal to
 * write a different script"), and it runs only in ship-it step 4.4 — whereas
 * `npm test` runs in CI (ci.yml), publish.yml and `npm run quality:changed`.
 * Same shape and home as scripts/__tests__/repo-hygiene.test.mjs.
 *
 * SCOPE: the governed file allowlist only. A repo-wide ban would fire on ~40
 * legitimate literals (destructive buttons, preview panes, connectivity
 * panels) and would be switched off within a week. A single literal inside a
 * governed file may be exempted with a `severity-exempt: <reason>` marker on
 * its own or the preceding line — see the stop button in ToolCallStep.tsx.
