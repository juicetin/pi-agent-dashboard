/**
 * Knip entry-point derivation — keeps `knip.json` honest against the manifests.
 *
 * Knip cannot infer this repo's entry points, and an UNROOTED graph does not
 * merely under-report: it reports reachable files as dead. Measured during the
 * spike — with no config, Knip claimed 723 findings and 90 unused files, of
 * which `canvas-tool.ts` (imported on the next line by `bridge.ts`),
 * `flow-question-adapter.ts` and `remote-connect-preload.ts` were plain false
 * positives. Rooting the graph took it to 437 findings and 10 unused files, all
 * ten exact-verified true positives.
 *
 * Three entry conventions are load-bearing and non-obvious:
 *   - `pi-dashboard-plugin` { client, server, bridge } — the dashboard plugins
 *   - `pi.extensions` — pi extensions, whose entry lives in a pi manifest
 *   - shell-invoked `scripts/**` — run as `node x.mjs` from .sh and CI, never
 *     imported, so Knip cannot see the edge (a DEAD script is undetectable;
 *     that is the accepted blind spot, see docs/code-quality.md)
 *
 * `--check` fails when a manifest declares an entry `knip.json` does not carry,
 * which is how the config is stopped from silently drifting back to unrooted.
 *
 * See change: add-knip-dead-code-oracle.
