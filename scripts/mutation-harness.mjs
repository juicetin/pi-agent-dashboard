/**
 * Scripted mutation harness for the promise-rule ladder (test-plan #X15).
 *
 * The ladder's highest-likelihood failure is invisible in a green run: a fix
 * that removes a `noFloatingPromises` diagnostic while ALSO removing the test's
 * teeth. Adding `await` to a fire-then-assert test, or settling a promise the
 * wrong way, can make a test pass while it proves strictly less than before.
 *
 * A passing test suite cannot detect that. Mutation can: break a behaviour the
 * test covers and the test MUST go red. A test file that stays green under
 * mutation is not protecting anything.
 *
 * No mutation tooling exists in this repo (no Stryker), and pulling one in for
 * a handful of files is disproportionate — hence this small, explicit,
 * manifest-driven runner. It is deliberately reusable by later ladder rungs:
 * add entries to a manifest, not code.
 *
 * CRASH SAFETY — read before changing the write path.
 *
 * This file writes broken code into REAL tracked source files. The `finally` in
 * `verifyTeeth` restores them, which is correct for a *thrown* error and does
 * nothing for a *dead process*: `finally` never runs when the process is killed
 * without unwinding (SIGKILL, OOM kill, an outer timeout, a sleeping machine).
 * That is not hypothetical — it left mutations on disk across two worktrees for
 * ~4.5 hours.
 *
 * So every mutation is journaled to `.mutation-journal/` BEFORE the source file
 * is written, and `reconcile()` recovers leftovers at the start of the next run
 * (wired as a root-level vitest `globalSetup`, so it completes before any test
 * project can load a mutated file). The journal is the backstop; the `finally`
 * and the SIGINT/SIGTERM handler are only fast paths.
 *
 * Durability promised: survives PROCESS death (the writes have returned and are
 * in the page cache). NOT power-loss durable — there is no `fsync` here, by
 * decision, because power loss is outside the failure set this guards.
 *
 * Single writer: one harness run per working tree at a time. Two concurrent
 * runs would restore each other's mutations and reproduce the exact residue
 * this guards against, so a second run that finds an existing entry for a file
 * it is about to mutate REFUSES (see `writeJournalEntry`).
 *
 * OWNERSHIP — why entries carry a pid. `runTestFile` spawns `npx vitest`, and
 * that child loads the ROOT vitest config, `globalSetup` included. Without an
 * owner check the child would reconcile the mutation its own parent just
 * applied, run the test against restored code, and report every mutation as
 * survived — the harness silently losing its teeth. The same hazard exists for
 * an unrelated `npm test` in another terminal. So an entry whose owning process
 * is still ALIVE is in-flight work, not residue, and reconciliation leaves it
 * strictly alone.
 *
 * See change: cleanup-async-semantics-server-extension.
 * See change: harden-mutation-harness-restore.
