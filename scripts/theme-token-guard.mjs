/**
 * Theme-token guard (D8) — the durable half of the accent-ramp repair.
 *
 * Two arms, both RATCHETS against an enumerated baseline:
 *
 *  1. fallback-form  — `var(--token, #rrggbb)` used for a themed paint. A
 *     fallback literal is authored against exactly ONE theme, so while the
 *     token is undeclared the literal paints in EVERY theme while the text
 *     layered on it stays theme-aware. Invisible in the theme it was authored
 *     for, severe in the other (measured 1.52:1 on the Gateway Setup tab).
 *
 *  2. undeclared     — a color custom property referenced by a component but
 *     declared nowhere in the theme layer.
 *
 * Neither arm may be a sweep. When this check landed the client carried 72
 * fallback-form bindings across 19 files, and `--border` / `--danger` /
 * `--success` / `--accent-fg` / `--bg-input` / `--border-focus` were all
 * referenced-but-undeclared. A rule failing on those fails on the day it lands
 * and forces the repo-wide reflow add-zrok-custom-reserved-name declares out of
 * scope. So each arm records what exists and fails only on what is ADDED.
 *
 * The baseline only ever SHRINKS: an entry present on disk but absent from the
 * baseline fails (a new binding), and repairing a site means deleting its
 * baseline entry, after which reintroducing it fails too. Each entry carries an
 * OCCURRENCE COUNT, not just presence, so adding a second identical binding to
 * a file that already has one is also caught — presence-only keys would let a
 * site grow silently under its own baseline entry.
 *
 * Refresh a shrunk baseline with:  node scripts/theme-token-guard.mjs --write
 *
 * See change: add-zrok-custom-reserved-name.
