/**
 * Assemble site/dist/ — the artifact GitHub Pages uploads.
 *
 *   node build.mjs        (or: npm run build)
 *
 * The site is a hand-written static page, so "build" is a copy with a
 * manifest, not a compile. It still exists as a step for three reasons:
 *   1. `dist/` is what deploy-site.yml uploads; keeping that contract means
 *      the workflow's artifact path and the /app shell copy are untouched.
 *   2. design-scratch/ (236 MB of renders, labs and reference captures) must
 *      never reach the artifact. An explicit allowlist guarantees that far
 *      more reliably than an ignore list.
 *   3. It fails loudly when a referenced asset is missing, instead of
 *      deploying a page with a broken <img> nobody notices.
