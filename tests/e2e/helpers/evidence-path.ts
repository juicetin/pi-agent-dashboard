 * Resolve where a change's recorded measurements live — WITHOUT creating it.
 *
 * Both measurement specs used to hardcode
 * `openspec/changes/verify-subagent-pull-under-load/measurements.json` and call
 * `mkdirSync(..., { recursive: true })`. Once the change was archived, that
 * combination CONJURED the pre-archive directory back into existence: tooling
 * that enumerates `openspec/changes/*` then saw a phantom active change, and —
 * worse for evidence integrity — the write landed somewhere other than the
 * archived `heap-evidence.md`'s source of truth, so a re-measure looked like it
 * left the archived numbers unchanged while actually recording different ones
 * elsewhere. That is precisely the staleness the evidence file exists to
 * prevent. See issue #549.
 *
 * So this resolver never creates anything. It reports where the change
 * genuinely is, and throws when it cannot tell — a misdirected write must be
 * loud, not silent.
