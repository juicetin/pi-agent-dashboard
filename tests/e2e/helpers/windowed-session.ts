/**
 * Shared glue for L3 specs that need the SERVER running with a real replay
 * window (`memoryLimits.maxReplayEvents > 0`, optionally
 * `replayWindowMode: "tail-only"`).
 *
 * ── Why this module exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `maxReplayEvents` / `replayWindowMode` are read ONCE, at server construction
 * (`cli.ts` → `ServerConfig` → `createBrowserGateway`), so they are restart-only
 * fields on the ONE container every spec shares. Arranging a windowed session is
 * therefore a fixed five-step dance: read the current limits, build a long
 * transcript BEFORE windowing is armed, write the new limits, restart the
 * daemon, and restore both the limits and the session in `afterAll`.
 *
 * `history-backfill-gap.spec.ts`, `history-backfill-perf.spec.ts` and
 * `max-replay-events-setting.spec.ts` each grew their own private copy of that
 * dance. `add-tail-only-replay-window` needs three more spec files, which would
 * have made six. The copies are consolidated here instead.
 *
 * ── This is NOT new infrastructure ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Worth stating plainly, because a planning note in this change once claimed the
 * opposite and blocked on it. Nothing here boots a second container, adds a
 * Playwright project, or teaches `docker/test-up.sh` a new flag. Every primitive
 * it uses — `PUT /api/config`, `POST /api/restart`, the `[[faux:long-transcript]]`
 * fixture — is shipped and exercised by the three specs named above. The only
 * change is that the glue now lives in one place.
 *
 * The `page.route()`-cannot-intercept-WebSocket objection is real but
 * irrelevant: these specs do not intercept the protocol, they CONFIGURE the
 * server and then observe real frames via `watchBackfillFrames`.
 *
 * See change: add-tail-only-replay-window; fix-lazy-history-backfill-ux (D7).
