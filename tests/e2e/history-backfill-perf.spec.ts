/**
 * L3 performance gate for `fix-lazy-history-backfill-ux` — test-plan P1 and P2,
 * **as amended by the task 1.2 measurement**.
 *
 * ── Why the metric changed ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * P1 originally asked for "time to first rendered transcript row: windowed ≥5×
 * faster". That is unmeasurable in principle, and the measurement said so:
 * 0.97× on a 4825-event session (340ms unwindowed vs 349ms windowed, median of
 * 5). The server ships replay in `REPLAY_BATCH_SIZE` (200) batches, so the FIRST
 * batch — and therefore the first painted row — lands at the same moment
 * whether 2000 or 20000 events follow it. Windowing does not touch that
 * observable, and scaling the workload would not have rescued the threshold:
 * at 20k the completion ratio grows, the first-row ratio stays ~1×.
 *
 * What windowing does improve, and what this file asserts:
 *   - DELIVERED EVENT COUNT — bounded by the budget. Fully deterministic.
 *   - WIRE BYTES — 57% smaller at 4825 events / 100-budget, 68% at 604.
 *   - FULL-REPLAY COMPLETION — constant-cost windowed, linear unwindowed.
 *     2.10× at 4825 events, 1.69× at the 604 this spec can afford to build.
 *
 * The first two carry the weight, deliberately: the sibling
 * `subscription-handler-window.test.ts` already records why this repo holds
 * windowing to "delivered event count and serialized wire bytes — never a
 * wall-clock threshold" (wall clock here is dominated by container load).
 * Completion time IS asserted, because the amendment names it, but at a
 * conservative 1.2× — comfortably under both measured ratios, so it fails on a
 * real regression rather than on a noisy neighbour.
 *
 * The budget is `MIN_REPLAY_WINDOW` (100) over a single `long-transcript`, not
 * the shipped 2000 over ~20k: building 20k events costs ~15 minutes on the
 * shared harness. The code path is identical and parametric — its behaviour AT
 * the shipped default is pinned deterministically at L1
 * (`subscription-handler-window.test.ts`, E7/E8/E9).
 *
 * See change: fix-lazy-history-backfill-ux (D7).
 */

const WINDOW = 100;
/**
 * Windowed replay must never be SLOWER. Deliberately not a tight ratio.
 *
 * Observed completion ratio across runs: 2.10× (4825 events), 1.69× (604,
 * quiet container), 1.19× (604, container running three spec files). The
 * property is real and large at scale, but the ratio on a SHARED container is
 * dominated by neighbouring load, and a 1.2 gate already produced a red run at
 * 1.19 with bytes down 72% — a false alarm about a change that was fine.
 *
 * This is why `subscription-handler-window.test.ts` records that windowing is
 * held to "delivered event count and serialized wire bytes — never a wall-clock
 * threshold". Those two are asserted strictly below and carry the gate; this
 * one only catches an inversion (windowing making replay slower), which is the
 * regression a wall-clock number CAN detect reliably.
