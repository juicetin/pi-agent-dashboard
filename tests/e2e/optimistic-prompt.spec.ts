/**
 * Browser E2E for change: optimistic-prompt-progress.
 *
 * Drives the real `prompt → bridge → server → events → DOM` round-trip via the
 * faux model (no LLM key). Only the LLM is faux; the bridge `prompt_received`
 * ack, protocol, reducer, and rendering are all real — exactly the chain this
 * change touches.
 *
 * Two user-observable invariants are asserted (the sub-second
 * sending→sent→confirmed micro-transitions are covered deterministically by the
 * unit/render tests — `event-reducer.test.ts`, `ChatView.test.tsx`):
 *
 *   1. IDLE send  → optimistic bubble appears instantly, then confirms with no
 *                   leftover card (the gap this change removes).
 *   2. MID-TURN   → no optimistic bubble; the authoritative follow-up queue chip
 *                   renders instead (idle-scoping; governed by
 *                   `mid-turn-prompt-queue`).
 *
 * Faux marker source of truth: qa/fixtures/faux-scenarios.ts.
 * Requires PI_E2E_SEED=1 (managed mode sets it automatically).

/**
 * Delay every server→client WebSocket frame so the sub-second optimistic window
 * (sending → sent → confirmed) is comfortably observable. The optimistic bubble
 * is written client-side instantly on send; it clears when the server's user
 * `message_start` echo arrives — holding that echo back widens the window. This
 * mirrors the exact condition the feature targets: a slow link where the echo
 * lags. (CDP `emulateNetworkConditions` does NOT throttle an already-open WS,
 * so we intercept the socket itself via Playwright's WebSocket routing.)
 *
 * Must be installed BEFORE the page opens its socket — call it before any
 * navigation. HTTP `/api/health` is unaffected (separate from the WS).
