/**
 * Browser E2E — route-backed overlays (change: add-route-backed-overlay-dialogs).
 *
 * These assert the ONE-URL-ONE-SURFACE rule that design D5 rests on, and they
 * need a real browser: nothing unit-tests `App`, so the container wiring in
 * App.tsx has no jsdom coverage at all. The pure resolution underneath (which
 * route dismisses to where) is unit-tested in overlay-background.test.ts.
 *
 *   S-12 — at `/tunnel-setup` exactly one overlay is mounted; settings is NOT
 *          mounted simultaneously. This is the whole of "replaces, not stacks":
 *          `/tunnel-setup` is its own URL, so `settingsMatch` is false there.
 *   S-13 — dismissing leaves the surface and changes the URL.
 *
 * S-13 is covered here in its COLD-LOAD form only. The plan states it as
 * "opened /tunnel-setup from /settings/gateway", but no in-app affordance
 * navigates to /tunnel-setup anywhere in the repo today — it is reachable by URL
 * alone. Driving it via a synthetic history push would assert the test's own
 * setup rather than a user path. The launcher-based return to /settings/gateway
 * is pinned instead at the unit level (resolveDismissTarget, D1d).
