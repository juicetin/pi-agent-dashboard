/**
 * L3 gate for D7a — the `tail-only` splice anchor. Test-plan rows F9, F10, F18
 * (change: add-tail-only-replay-window).
 *
 * ── What D7a claims, and why it needs a real browser ────────────────────────
 * `fix-lazy-history-backfill-ux` (D6) removed scroll anchoring on the grounds
 * that events splice BELOW the divider, so nothing above the reading position
 * moves and `scrollTop` is the invariant. That holds while the divider is
 * mid-transcript. In `tail-only` the divider is the FIRST row, so the spliced
 * rows land between the loading head and everything else: "leave `scrollTop`
 * alone" pins the user to the head while the content they asked for accumulates
 * below, and — with the rising-edge rule — proximity never lapses, so the walk
 * stalls.
 *
 * So the two modes must NOT share the branch, which is the whole point of F10
 * sitting beside F9 in this file: each mode is asserted against the other's
 * behaviour, and a regression that collapses them into one branch turns one of
 * the two red whichever way it collapses.
 *
 * ── How the invariant is stated ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * By the ROW, which is what D7a actually names.
 *
 * An earlier draft asserted the geometric proxy `Δ scrollTop === Δ scrollHeight`
 * instead, reasoning that absorbing the spliced height is the same as holding
 * the row. It is NOT, and the harness said so: the proxy left a ~3200px
 * residual on a 34000px splice even with a correct anchor, because
 * `scrollHeight` also grows when rows BELOW the viewport remeasure away from
 * their estimates. That growth moves nothing the user is looking at, and an
 * implementation that absorbed it would be over-correcting — so the proxy
 * fails a correct implementation and passes an over-correcting one. Exactly
 * backwards.
 *
 * The row is addressed through `data-row-key`, which carries the row's message
 * id and therefore survives a splice that shifts every `data-index`. That
 * attribute exists for the IMPLEMENTATION (the anchor re-locates its row
 * through it after the coarse correction remounts it), not for this test; the
 * test reuses a real product handle rather than introducing a test-only one.
 *
 * `head-tail` asserts the complementary property: `Δ scrollTop === 0`.
 *
 * ── Tolerance is a requirement, not a fudge ─────────────────────────────────
 * D7a says so explicitly: with `overflowAnchor: "none"` and a virtualizer whose
 * spliced rows carry ESTIMATED sizes until measured, the height at commit is an
 * estimate and the anchor keeps correcting until measurement settles. The
 * invariant is a BOUNDED DRIFT, not a fixed pixel. `DRIFT_TOLERANCE_PX` is
 * therefore generous relative to the ≤8px scroll tolerance the sibling
 * `head-tail` rows use — those measure a quantity that does not move at all.
 *
 * See change: add-tail-only-replay-window (D7a); fix-lazy-history-backfill-ux (D6).
 */

/**
 * Bound on the anchor residual once measurement has settled.
 *
 * Non-vacuity is what makes this number safe: the splice grows `scrollHeight`
 * by MANY thousands of px (the sibling spec measured 4309 → 40883 for one
 * max-span slice), and every test below asserts that growth explicitly. A
 * regression that skips the anchor entirely leaves a residual equal to the FULL
 * spliced height — three orders of magnitude outside this bound, not a near
 * miss. The tolerance absorbs estimate convergence; it cannot absorb a missing
 * implementation.
