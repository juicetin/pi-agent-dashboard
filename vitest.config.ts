/**
 * Root Vitest config (Vitest 4+).
 *
 * Vitest 4 dropped `vitest.workspace.ts` support — projects must live under
 * `test.projects` here. Each entry points at a per-package vitest.config.ts
 * which carries the package-specific `environment` (jsdom for client, node
 * for server/shared/extension), include globs, and pool settings.
 *
 * `globalSetup` lives HERE, at root, on purpose: it reconciles leftovers from a
 * killed mutation-harness run, and must complete before ANY project fork loads
 * a source file. Projects run concurrently, so a per-project reconcile would
 * race them. See scripts/mutation-journal-global-setup.mjs.
